# Admin & storefront acceptance matrix

Phase 1 of the Riso Press redesign. This is the **behavior contract**: a visual
change to a screen may not remove anything listed here. Verify a screen against
its row before and after restyling it. Sources: the code in `src/app/admin/*`,
`src/app/lib/commerce.ts`, `functions/index.js`.

## Non-negotiable protections (apply to every row)

- Checkout totals are server-authoritative (Stripe session); the client only displays them.
- Orders are created `unpaid`; only `stripeWebhook` marks them paid, decrements stock, counts discounts, records revenue. The admin "Mark paid" button calls the admin-authenticated `markOrderPaid` Cloud Function (Bearer ID token) and is gated by a confirmation dialog — never a client-side Firestore write.
- Admin auth is Google sign-in restricted to `lyricalmyricalbooks@gmail.com` (`admin/api.ts` + `ADMIN_EMAILS`/`requireAdmin`).
- Theme `design` (live) and `draftDesign` (draft) stay separate; Discard Draft never touches `design`.
- Fulfillment and address-verification states stay visible on orders.
- Accessible names and keyboard behaviour cannot regress.

## Responsive & keyboard checklist (per screen family)

Widths 375 / 768 / 1024 / 1440 / wide. Tab order follows visual order; dialogs
trap focus, close on Escape, restore focus; tables scroll horizontally inside
their region; no horizontal page scroll; controls usable at 200% zoom;
`prefers-reduced-motion` honoured; print views for receipts/packing slips.
