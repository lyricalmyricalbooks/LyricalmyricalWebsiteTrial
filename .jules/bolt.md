## 2024-05-18 - Memoizing String Computations for Search Filters
**Learning:** In a React application, frequently typed inputs causing filter functions to re-run on arrays can be an unseen performance bottleneck. Every keystroke triggers an `Array.prototype.filter` or `.map` over the entire catalog. Within these callbacks, constructing strings via concatenation/joining and calling `.toLowerCase()` forces the engine to allocate new memory for strings on every tick.
**Action:** Use a `WeakMap` mapped to the underlying object reference (e.g. `Book` or `CatalogItem`) to cache the pre-computed lowercased search string ("haystack") or lowercased properties. Since it's a `WeakMap`, memory leaks are avoided when the object is garbage collected. Next time, always investigate `.toLowerCase()` or `.join()` inside heavy loops or filter callbacks that react to frequent input changes.

## 2024-05-19 - O(1) Cache Lookups for Constant Arrays
**Learning:** Functions that frequently search through a static array using `.find()` and `.toLowerCase()` (like `COUNTRIES.find(...)`) cause O(N) array iteration and O(N) string memory allocations per call. When these functions are called during renders or loops (e.g. `matchShippingZone` in checkout), they can block the main thread.
**Action:** Always convert static list lookups that rely on computed string comparisons into an O(1) `Map` that is built exactly once at module load time. This completely eliminates both the array traversal overhead and the repeated string allocations.

## 2024-05-20 - Eliminating N+1 Queries in Order History
**Learning:** Iterating through orders or order items and dispatching asynchronous requests sequentially (`await getBook(id)` inside a `for...of` loop) creates a classic N+1 query problem, heavily delaying UI rendering and duplicating API requests when identical items exist across multiple orders.
**Action:** Always batch requests by collecting a unique `Set` of IDs from the dataset and fetching them concurrently using `Promise.all()`. Then, populate a local cache/map to resolve the references synchronously when looping through the original dataset.

## 2024-05-21 - Optimizing Re-Renders in Filter Loops
**Learning:** We observed identical `.toLowerCase()` allocations occurring in `BookCatalog.tsx` when filtering books. I applied a `useMemo` combined with a `WeakMap` to lazily construct and cache the lookup strings.
**Action:** When filtering objects where only the search query changes, cache the object's computed search string (`haystack`) using a `WeakMap` indexed by the object itself.

## 2026-06-18 - Eliminating O(N) Array Lookups in Cart Iteration
**Learning:** Functions that frequently iterate through cart items and search for corresponding catalog items using `.find()` (e.g. `booksCatalog.find(b => b.id === item.id)`) cause O(N*M) complexity (where N is cart items and M is total books). In large catalogs, performing these nested lookups during checkout discount validations and calculations can significantly block the main thread and delay rendering.
**Action:** Always create a `useMemo` map or a local Map keyed by ID (e.g. `Map<string, Book>`) before iterating over cart items to reduce the catalog lookup time to O(1).

## 2024-06-19 - Eliminating O(N*M) Array Lookups in Cart Iteration
**Learning:** In `CartDrawer.tsx`, using `.find()` inside of a `flatMap()` or similar iterations across the entire `cart` to search through the entire `books` catalog creates a massive O(N*M) performance drag, unnecessarily blocking the main thread.
**Action:** When filtering or matching multiple items from a large list against another large list, wrap the list creation inside `useMemo()` and map them into an O(1) `Map` keyed by `id`. Then, reference the cached `Map` instead of re-iterating.

## 2026-06-20 - Eliminating Sequential Firebase Queries in Analytics
**Learning:** Sequential `await` calls for independent Firebase collections (like `analytics`, `orders`, `books`) create a waterfall effect, significantly slowing down the load time of dashboards. This forces the client to wait for each network round-trip to complete before starting the next one.
**Action:** Always fetch independent data concurrently using `Promise.all()` to parallelize network requests and eliminate the waterfall bottleneck.
## 2024-11-09 - Eliminate O(N*M) lookups in Checkout Shipping Zones
**Learning:** In `Checkout.tsx`, the `calculateStaticProfileRates` function iterated over profile zones using nested `.find`, `.some` and `.toLowerCase()` operations to match the customer`s country. This led to heavy O(N*M) iterations and string allocations which blocked the main thread.
**Action:** When performing geographic lookups based on countries, utilize a pre-computed lookup Map (like `countryLookupMap` within `matchShippingZone`) and cache arrays like `shippingProfiles` in a `Map` prior to iterating across shopping cart items to reduce lookup complexities to O(1).

## 2026-06-23 - Eliminating O(N*M) Array Lookups and Sorting in Checkout Loop
**Learning:** In `Checkout.tsx`, the `calculateStaticProfileRates` function iterates over multiple shipping profile rate lists inside a map over unique cart rate names, resulting in repeated `.find()` lookups and array `.sort()` operations. For large carts and multiple profiles, this results in an O(N*M*log(M)) complexity and blocks the main thread with string evaluations.
**Action:** Pre-compute maps to cache the rates (keyed by name) for each profile and the fallback cheapest rate outside the loop. In the loop, use an O(1) `.get()` from the `Map` to instantly find the correct rate, resolving complex nested lookups gracefully.

## 2024-11-10 - Memoizing Checkout Discount Calculations
**Learning:** In large React components like `Checkout`, computing complex derived state (such as calculating discounts with `.filter()`, `.some()`, and array `.sort()`) directly inline inside the functional component body blocks the main thread on every render. This becomes particularly problematic and laggy when typing into uncontrolled or frequently changing input fields like email and promo codes since the root component re-evaluates all discount constraints (which can involve O(N*M) lookups) on every keystroke.
**Action:** Always wrap heavy derived calculations in `useMemo` when they rely on stable data structures (like `cart` and `appliedDiscount`), ensuring that text input re-renders do not redundantly re-run intensive array processing logic.

## 2024-06-26 - Eliminating O(N*M) Array Lookups in Admin Orders Bulk Operations
**Learning:** In `Orders.tsx`, when selecting or deselecting rows to perform bulk operations, verifying properties with `.find()` (e.g. `orders.find(o => o.id === id)?.isTest`) inside iterations across selected IDs creates an O(N*M) complexity drag. Even in an admin table, repeatedly scanning an array is inefficient when you can cache lookups.
**Action:** Always create a `useMemo` map or a local Map keyed by ID (e.g. `Map<string, Order>`) prior to iterating across selection arrays to reduce the property lookup time to O(1).

## 2024-11-12 - Reusing Context Memoized Values Instead of Inline Reduces
**Learning:** In React components consuming Context (like `Checkout` consuming `CartContext`), performing inline array operations such as `cart.reduce()` or `cartItems.reduce()` within render loops or even event callbacks forces unnecessary O(N) evaluations. This is especially inefficient when the Context already calculates and exposes memoized aggregates like `cartCount` or `cartTotal`.
**Action:** When consuming context-provided collections, always utilize existing pre-calculated memoized values (e.g., `cartCount`, `cartTotal`) instead of performing inline array operations inside component render trees or event callbacks to eliminate redundant O(N) evaluations.
## 2024-11-14 - Eliminate O(N*M) Array Lookups in Cart Item Loops
**Learning:** Using `Array.prototype.includes()` inside an iterative array method like `filter()`, `some()`, or `reduce()` over `cartItems` or `cart` when comparing against constraint lists (e.g. `discount.selectedCategories` or `discount.selectedProducts`) results in O(N*M) nested iterations. When executed during uncontrolled component renders (like Checkout form typing), this significantly degrades performance and blocks the main thread.
**Action:** When filtering or validating a large list of cart items against an array of criteria, convert the constraint arrays into an O(1) `Set` *before* the loop, and use `Set.has()` instead of `Array.includes()` inside the loop callbacks. This changes the complexity to O(N+M) and removes the bottleneck.
