## What this is

An e-commerce storefront + admin for **Lyricalmyrical Books**, a publisher.
It's a single-page React app (the public bookstore and the admin dashboard are
the same SPA), backed by **Firebase** (Firestore, Auth, Storage) and a set of
**Cloud Functions** that handle payments, email, and fulfillment. The UI was
originally generated from a Figma design ("Artsy Website for Publisher").

> Note: `README.md` still documents an older Express `backend/server.js` with a
> password-protected admin. That backend no longer exists — payments,
> fulfillment, and admin auth have all moved to Firebase (see below). Trust this
> file and the actual code over the README's "Backend API + Admin" section.

## Tech stack

- **React 18 + TypeScript**, built with **Vite 6**.
- **React Router 7** (`react-router`) — client-side routing in `src/app/App.tsx`.
- **Tailwind CSS v4** (via `@tailwindcss/vite`) for styling; **shadcn/ui** +
  **Radix UI** primitives in `src/app/components/ui/`.
- **MUI** and **motion** (Framer Motion successor) are also present for some
  components/animations.
- **Firebase 11** client SDK (`src/lib/firebaseApp.ts` app + App Check; `src/lib/firebase.ts` full Firestore + Auth;
  `src/lib/firestoreLite.ts` shopper Firestore Lite — see *Storefront bundle* below, project
  `lyricalmyrical-web-v2`). A secondary "legacy" Firebase project is used for
  inventory sync (`src/lib/legacyFirebase.ts`).
- **Stripe** for checkout, **Resend** for transactional email, **Shippo** for
  address verification / shipping labels — all wired through Cloud Functions.
- **Vitest** for tests.

### Routes (`src/app/App.tsx`)
`/` storefront · `/books/:slug` · `/collections/:slug` · `/wishlist` ·
`/account/*` · `/page/:slug` · `/admin/*` · `/checkout` · `/track`

Pages are lazy-loaded via `React.lazy` + `Suspense`.

### Firestore collections
`books`, `authors`, `orders`, `discounts`, `reviews`, `pages`, `newsletter`,
`analytics`, plus a settings doc and audit log. Always check `firestore.rules`
before changing read/write shapes — rules are enforced server-side.

## Commands

```bash
npm install          # install deps
npm run dev          # Vite dev server (localhost:5173)
npm run build        # vite build + generate sitemap -> dist/
npm run preview      # preview the production build
npm test             # vitest run
npm run build:sitemap
npm run check:readability
```

Cloud Functions are a separate package:
```bash
cd functions && npm install
npm run serve        # firebase emulators (functions only)
npm run deploy       # firebase deploy --only functions
npm run logs
```

## Auth & admin access

- Admin login is **Google sign-in**, hard-restricted to
  `lyricalmyricalbooks@gmail.com` (see `src/app/admin/api.ts` and the
  `ADMIN_EMAILS` allowlist + `requireAdmin` in `functions/index.js`). There is
  no password-based admin anymore.
- Cloud Functions verify the Firebase ID token and require a verified admin
  email for privileged endpoints.

## Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)

- `createStripeCheckoutSession` — secure Stripe session creation.
  With `paymentElement: true` it creates a server-priced PaymentIntent instead, for the card form
  shown directly on the checkout page (`features/site/StripeCardForm.tsx`, Stripe Payment Element,
  deferred intent); `stripeWebhook` marks those paid on `payment_intent.succeeded` (metadata
  `checkout: "payment_element"`). `body.action` = `status` / `registerPaymentDomain` serve the
  return-page check and the wallet-domain button (no new public functions: the CI deploy account
  can't set IAM on them). Storefront card payment always uses the inline Payment Element;
  older saved redirect settings no longer move the shopper to hosted Checkout.
- `stripeWebhook` — the **only** path that marks Stripe orders paid; it also
  decrements stock, counts discount redemptions, and records revenue. Orders are
  created `unpaid` first.
- Checkout **order note / gift message** (`orderNote` on the order, max 500 chars, enforced in `firestore.rules`): Studio › Style › Checkout & cart drawer › **Order note / gift message box at checkout** (`showOrderNote`, off by default); words in Text & labels › Checkout; shown to admins in Order detail › Customer.
- `downloadDigitalAsset` — gated digital ebook downloads.
- `onOrderPaid` / `onOrderShipped` — Firestore triggers that send customer/admin
  emails (Resend).
- `abandonedCartSweep` — scheduled recovery email after ~1h.
- **Email delivery log:** every `sendEmail` attempt (sent or failed, with a plain-English reason from
  `functions/emailErrors.js`) is written to the admin-only `emailLog` collection and listed in
  Settings › Notifications › **Recent deliveries**. Customer and shop-copy sends are attempted
  separately, so a rejected customer address never suppresses the admin notification.
- `onBookRestocked` — emails shoppers in `stockAlerts` (created from the sold-out product page's
  "Notify me when back in stock" box, `features/site/BackInStockForm.tsx`) when a book/variant goes
  0 → available. Studio › Style › Product page layout › **Notify me when back in stock** toggles the box;
  its words are in Text & labels › Product page.

- `unpaidPaymentSweep` (every 15 minutes) — records pending reconciliation and emails the shop when Stripe
  shows a successful payment but the order is still unpaid 10 min–7 days later (`functions/paymentSweep.js`);
  stamps `paymentAlertSentAt`. Never marks Stripe orders paid — resend the verified webhook event from Stripe.
- `nightlyFirestoreBackup` (03:17 Toronto) — exports Firestore to `gs://<storageBucket>/backups/YYYY-MM-DD`.
  Needs the Functions service account to have **Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin** + bucket write.

**Email sending:** `sendEmail` sends through Gmail SMTP (nodemailer, account `lyricalmyricalbooks@gmail.com`) first, because the shop has no Resend-verified domain. The Gmail app password is entered in Settings › Notifications › **Gmail sending** (`admin/GmailSendingCard.tsx`) and stored in the admin-only `adminSecrets/gmail` doc (never in public `settings/*`). If it is unset or Gmail fails, sending falls back to Resend (`onboarding@resend.dev` only reaches the account owner).

Secrets (`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `RESEND_API_KEY`,
`SHIPPO_API_TOKEN`) are stored as Firebase Functions secrets, not in the repo.

## Shipping engine

`functions/shippingEngine.js` (server, authoritative) and `src/app/features/site/shippingEngine.ts`
(display mirror) turn profiles → zones → rates into checkout quotes; `shippingEngine.parity.test.ts`
keeps them identical, so change both together. Rate `type`: flat | order | weight | percent | free |
pickup, plus conditions (order total / cart grams / item count), `freeOver`, `handlingFee`; profiles
add `freeShippingOver`, `handlingFee`, `defaultItemWeightG`. The server charges the quote matching
the customer's `shippingMethod` (else cheapest) and rejects unservable destinations; profiles with no
zones fall back to legacy flat `calculateShipping`. Live Shippo quotes can be enabled for an explicit
country allowlist in Settings › Shipping › Carrier & labels; all other countries use the regular
profile/zone path. Selected live quotes are fetched and validated again server-side so the charged
amount matches checkout. Admin UI: Settings › Shipping › profile editor (Profile rules, Test this
profile, rate dialog).

## Theme editor

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The default Admin → Settings → Design editor is the new Studio editor**
> (`src/app/admin/studio/StudioEditor.tsx`; left rail **Page layout / Theme settings /
> Text & labels / Navigation / Pages**). It is the **only** designer: the old `ThemeEditor.tsx`,
> `ThemeEditorPro.tsx`, `ThemeEditorBuilder.tsx`, `NewSectionLibraryModal` and `?editor=legacy` no
> longer exist. **Add or change every theme/design feature in Studio** — the user only sees Studio.
> The Studio 2.0 roadmap (navigation overhaul, Shopify-level features) is in `docs/THEME_EDITOR.md`. Shop categories (the storefront category bar) are edited in Studio › **Menus** ›
> **Shop categories**. They can also be created while editing a book in **Categories & tags**;
> that catalog workflow publishes the category immediately and synchronizes Studio's working copy.
> Custom pages (About, Journal…) also live only in Studio › **Pages** tab
> (`studio/StudioPages.tsx`); there is **no** separate Pages screen in the admin nav — do not
> re-add one. New pages join the storefront header by default, and their public
> routes render the themed storefront header. Walkthroughs must use Studio's
> labels, not legacy legacy-editor tabs.

Studio › Menus › Shop categories has a searchable category manager with explicit
Edit/Delete, descriptions, optional images, visibility, parent placement and order.
Counts show direct assignments (including aliases); parent roll-ups and the
automatic PUBLICATIONS all-books view are separate. The picker reads the entire
catalog, including drafts and records without createdAt. Category details follow
Save draft/Publish; book assignments have an explicit live Save action, use the
published category name, and cannot target unpublished categories. Bulk writes
read fresh tags in an atomic transaction (up to 400 books), touching only
categories/genres/updatedAt. Deletion keeps all books, promotes children and offers
keep/remove/move assignments, refreshing membership before and after cleanup.
For larger categories, use Edit › Assigned here in groups of up to 400 first.
**Find anything:** the Studio top bar **Find** button (or Ctrl/Cmd+K) searches every Style control, Text & labels
string, Menus panel, page, section and action (`studio/studioSearch.ts` + `StudioSearch.tsx`; `goToResult` in
`StudioEditor.tsx` navigates). It indexes `STYLE_GROUPS` and `COPY_SCHEMA`, so new controls are findable with no extra
work — give them clear labels. It also lists the parts of the previewed page and books, opens on commands for the current selection
(`contextCommands`), then Recent and Shortcuts; `>` searches commands only (`paletteGroups`). **Auto-fit for phones** (`studio/autoMobile.ts`) fills phone/tablet values from the
desktop design: Sections tab › *Auto-fit page for phones*, or section › Layout & style › *Phone & tablet layout*.

Studio's Sections outline supports sortable sections and blocks. Canvas clicks
open their inspector; **Edit mode** selects content and **Browse mode** lets
storefront links and controls work. **Style** has searchable controls with
**All pages / This page only** scope for supported visual groups. Save draft,
Publish and local unsaved recovery are separate actions. **My themes** (Style › Theme look) can be renamed, duplicated, downloaded as a file and re-imported. History provides
non-destructive snapshot Preview and Restore to draft; change-aware dialogs
guard Publish/Discard. Reusable/copyable sections, scheduled visibility,
phone overrides, canvas reordering and pre-publish checks also live in Studio. These live in
`studio/StudioEditor.tsx`, `StudioOutline.tsx`, `StudioInspector.tsx` and
`useStudioPersistence.ts`; `themeWrite.ts` replaces complete design maps when
saving so removed page overrides do not reappear. The iframe receives an atomic
`STUDIO_PREVIEW_STATE` snapshot of the unsaved design, settings, books and
published pages, keeping colors, menus and newly created page content live
across preview navigation without another Firestore read. Delivery uses both
`postMessage` and a same-origin message-event fallback so iframe load timing
cannot leave the canvas showing the published design. `buildPreviewState` makes the
snapshot clone-safe (`toCloneable` strips `_lastDoc` Firestore snapshots — they made
`postMessage` throw `DataCloneError` and silently froze the preview once books loaded).
In preview, `useSiteData` keeps the snapshot's books/pages/settings on `window.__studioPreviewState`
so a late Firestore load never overwrites them; chrome outside that pipeline (cookie banner,
boot splash) uses `useLiveDesign()`. **Preview in new tab** (Studio top bar) opens a full-screen
top-level `?preview=true` window: Studio posts the same snapshot on `BroadcastChannel("studio_preview")`
and `features/site/previewTab.ts` (started in `main.tsx`) re-dispatches it as a window message, answers
`PREVIEW_READY`, and keeps `?preview=true` on in-app navigation. Unsaved Studio › Pages edits ride
along in the snapshot (`withDraftPage`) without being saved.

Preview canvas actions resolve section ownership and block arrays from the
current draft, including global sections and dynamic `page:<slug>` templates.
Linked compositions inherit source children when a placement has no child
override. Studio Pages stays mounted across editor tabs; unsaved page edits are
protected on exit, typing during a save is retained, and Ctrl/Cmd+S saves the
active page. Page-load failures expose Retry. Pre-publish checks inspect global
and nested content, and identify image-size and contrast review as manual checks.

Studio also supports three-level recursive composition blocks through the
**Flexible composition** section. Groups can contain text, image, button, or
more group blocks; the active desktop/tablet/mobile preview controls local
alignment, visibility, and CSS-grid coordinates. Any configured block can be
promoted to a linked shared block and inserted in another block-capable section;
shared content updates everywhere while placement stays local. The preview
supports section and block drag/reorder plus schema-derived inline editing for
safe text fields.

Studio's announcement, header, navigation and footer are listed in **Page layout**'s Header / Footer groups
(the separate Shared layout tab was retired in 1.5; old `tab=shared` links open Page layout). In Edit mode, double-click plain text in the
iframe (or focus its edit hook and press Enter), then choose **Done** to commit
one undoable draft change or **Cancel** / Escape to restore it. Typing keeps the
preview stable; Save, Publish and Exit wait until the edit finishes. Announcement,
wordmark, masthead and footer labels edit their existing Studio fields. Linked
block text updates its shared source while placement stays local. Unsupported rich content
and templated labels open the inspector instead of flattening their content.
Browse mode restores normal interaction and removes editing focus hooks.

Studio canvas tools include a contextual section/block toolbar (Edit, Move up/down,
Duplicate, Hide, Delete and supported Add block). Plain-text clicks select on the
canvas without opening the inspector; Edit opens it. Structural actions on inherited
shared children stay unavailable, while their text edits still update the source.
Double-click supported rich-content fields for bold, italic, underline, links,
paragraph/heading style and alignment. Unsupported embeds/styles keep the inspector
path; formatted commits are sanitized and one undoable draft action.
**Spacing** exposes padding handles and renderer-supported gap handles. Dragging snaps
to 4px (Shift = 1px), arrow keys adjust values, and Escape cancels. The active preview
size controls desktop/tablet/phone scope; Reset removes that size's overrides. Numeric
spacing fields also live in Layout & style. The shared renderer applies padding once
at the content box and carries the same responsive overrides onto the storefront.

**Studio repairs (0.2):** every Studio image upload uses `uploadStudioImage` (`studio/mediaUpload.ts`) — never write
uploads outside a Storage folder `storage.rules` lets the admin write (`admin/storagePaths.test.ts`). Linked shared
blocks resolve centrally in `SectionList`; each section renders inside `SectionBoundary`. Phone/tablet widths come
only from `features/site/breakpoints.ts` (phone ≤767px, tablet ≤1023px). Scheduled designs follow
`features/site/scheduledDesign.mjs`. Save draft overwrites `theme-versions/draft-latest`; Publish adds a version.

**Private drafts (0.4):** Studio's unpublished draft is in admin-only `themes/workspace` (`draft`, `rev`) and
My themes in `savedThemes/{id}`; never add draft or theme data back to public `settings/website`. All Studio
saves go through `admin/themeStore.ts` (revision-checked; `ThemeConflictError` → merge or the conflict dialog).
Admin tools that change one design field outside Studio call `draftFieldUpdate`. Shopper code reads settings
with `adminApi.getPublicSettings()`, never `getSettings()` (which also reads admin-only key flags).
There is no public fallback any more (1.7): the first open copies an older public `draftDesign`/`savedThemes` across once and removes them; refused access raises `ThemeStoreUnavailableError` and Studio says so. `themeWrite` never writes a draft to `settings/website`. The fixture/tests swap storage with `setThemeBackend` (saves are recorded as `saveDesign`).

**One design resolver (0.5):** storefront code must resolve page designs only through
`features/site/designModel.ts` (`layerDesign`, or the `resolve*Design` helpers in `surfaceDesign.ts`) — never
`{ ...design, ...design.storefront }` by hand. Shop structure (`ROOT_ONLY_KEYS`) always comes from the root; `copy` and
`regions` merge per entry. Studio "All pages" writes go through `writeDesignValue` (sets root, clears page
overrides); "This page only" writes set the page surface. `designModel.property.test.ts` guards this against the
published design snapshot.

**Studio interaction rules (1.2):** never use `window.confirm/prompt/alert` in Studio — undoable actions run at once
with `say("ok", text, { label: "Undo", run })`, permanent ones use Riso `useConfirm`, names use `usePrompt`. Name every
edit: `change(fn, { label, coalesce })`. Add shortcuts to `studio/shortcuts.ts` (the cheat sheet reads the same table).
Link into Studio with `studioHash()` from `lib/studioLocation.ts` (`/admin#designer?…`); What's new links can carry `studio`.

**Pickers & catalog sources (2.3):** section/block fields of kind `link`, `book`, `books`, `category`, `page`, `video`,
`font` render Studio pickers (`studio/StudioPickers.tsx`, pure choices in `studio/pickers.ts`, data from
`StudioPickerProvider` in `StudioEditor`). They save the same strings as the old text boxes (hrefs like `/page/<slug>`,
`/collections/<slug>`, `/books/<storefront slug>`; comma-separated slugs; category names) — no migration, `siteHref` still
adds the sub-path. Never add a url-like section/block field as `text` (`sectionFieldKinds.test.ts`). Catalog sections pick
books only through `features/site/merchandising.ts` `selectBooks` / `sectionBookQuery` / `pickBook` (Studio: **Which books**
= all · featured · books I pick · shop category · newest · on sale · pre-orders, plus **Order**); without
`productSource`/`productSort` the result equals the old one (`catalogSources.test.ts`, `catalogSources.render.test.tsx`).

**Page structure (1.3/1.4):** Studio › Page layout lists the page the preview actually rendered — Header · Page · Footer ·
Pop-overs — from the bridge's `STRUCTURE` scan (`studio/pageStructure.ts`, `StudioStructure.tsx`). Any new storefront part
appears there automatically once it carries `data-studio-target` / `regionProps` and a `data-studio-label`; put header parts
inside `<header>`, footer parts inside `<footer>` and pop-overs in a `role="dialog"`. A new click-to-edit target needs a
name in `studio/targetLabels.ts` (its test fails otherwise). A new pop-over Studio should open goes in `STUDIO_OVERLAYS`
and listens with `useStudioOverlay`.
Section rows have a right-click menu (copy/paste section, copy/paste style, move to another page, save for reuse) and
Ctrl/⌘-click multi-select with a bulk bar; blocks move between sections of the same kind (row button, or drag in the
preview). Use `moveSectionTo` / `moveBlockTo` / `updateSectionsById` (`studio/studioWorkflow.ts`) for any new move or
bulk edit — never splice section arrays by hand.

Studio is a Shopify-style theme editor under `/admin`. **Read
`docs/THEME_EDITOR.md` before changing it** — it has the architecture map, the
section/block contract, and the Studio 2.0 roadmap.

- `src/app/admin/studio/` — Studio itself: `StudioEditor.tsx` (shell, top bar, rail, preview
  wiring), `StudioOutline.tsx` / `StudioInspector.tsx` (sections and blocks), `styleSchema.ts`
  (every Theme settings control), `settingsMap.ts` (where controls live), `studioModel.ts`
  (immutable design ops + undo), `previewBridge.ts` / `canvasBridge.ts` (in-preview editing),
  `useStudioPersistence.ts` (Save draft / Publish / recovery).
- `src/app/admin/ThemeEditorExtensions.tsx` — the `SECTION_REGISTRY` (34 section types),
  `getSectionFields`/`getBlockFields`, the shared field editors (`SectionFieldEditor`,
  `BlockFieldEditor`) and the per-section **Layout & style** panel (`SectionSettingsPanel`).
  It also exports `buildPageTemplates(pages)` — static `PAGE_TEMPLATES` plus one
  dynamic `page:<slug>` template per published custom page
  (`design["page:<slug>"].sections`, rendered by `PageView` with fallback to the
  shared `design.page.sections`).
- `src/app/components/SectionComponents.tsx` — the storefront section renderers
  (one per registry type; registry and renderers are now at parity).
- `src/app/components/sectionRender.tsx` — shared renderer: `SectionList` maps a
  section to its renderer **by name** (`(Sections as any)[section.type]`),
  `TemplateSections` renders `design[templateId].sections` for a page-type
  template, `GlobalSections` renders `design.globalSections`, and section
  wrappers emit stable `data-fm-section` / `data-section-id` hooks for preview
  click-to-edit, scoped per-section CSS, and template-aware preview selection. Used by MainSite and every standalone page
  (product/collection/page/cart all render their template's sections — milestone A).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Everything shopper-facing must be editable in Studio — nothing "built into the site".**
> Any storefront element (box, row, link, heading, text) needs a Studio control to hide/show it
> and its words in Text & labels (`COPY_SCHEMA`). Add the toggle to `STYLE_GROUPS` in
> `studio/styleSchema.ts` (default = current behaviour) in the same change that adds the element.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every design must be fully editable in Studio.** Each theme-library preset
> (`studio/themeLibrary.ts`) may only set keys that have a Studio › Style control in
> `STYLE_GROUPS`: top-level keys go through `THEME_APPLIED_KEYS`, everything else in the preset's
> `global`. `studio/themeLibrary.test.ts` fails on any preset key with no control, and
> `features/site/studioCoverage.test.ts` fails on any design key the storefront reads without one.
> Add the control in the same change as the design key — never allowlist around the test.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Every aspect of the public website must be editable in the designer (Studio).** No hard-coded
> colours in storefront code: use a design key (`design.x || "#hex"`) or a theme variable
> (`var(--token, #hex)`) — the hex may only be a fallback. Every section default needs a Content
> field (lists are edited as blocks). `features/site/designerCoverage.test.ts` enforces both,
> alongside `studioCoverage`, `storeCopy.coverage`, `studioTargets` and `themeLibrary` tests.
> Tailwind colour classes count too: every one the storefront uses (incl. `hover:`/`focus:`/
> `group-hover:`/`selection:`/`md:` variants) must be listed in `features/site/storefrontColorClasses.ts`,
> which `colorUtilityCss` in `themeTokens.ts` re-points at a Studio token (greys → text/muted/surface,
> black → overlay/page colour, hues → accent/success/warning/danger). `designerCoverage.test.ts` fails
> on an unlisted or unmappable class — add it to the list rather than hard-coding a colour.

**Custom pages share one look:** Studio › Style › **Custom pages** (`page*` design keys, `sitePageStyle`
in `PageView.tsx`) sets eyebrow, title size/case/colour, text size/colour, alignment and column
width for every custom page. Each "Page content" section follows it unless its **Style this page on
its own** switch (`ownStyle`) is on; pages without that section render the same component. Default is the Riso "Ruled" layout (Option D): no small "Page" label (`pageShowEyebrow`
off), the title lined up with the header (`pageWidth: "header"`, same width as the `StoreHeader` row), a line
under it (`pageShowRule`, `pageRuleColor/Width/Spacing`) and a readable text column (`pageTextMeasure`). Title
font/size px (desktop + phone)/weight and top spacing are `pageTitleFont`, `pageTitleSizePx*`, `pageTitleWeight`,
`pageTopSpacing`; the Page content section has the same fields for "Style this page on its own".

> (low-stock thresholds, recently-viewed count, search-result cap) and the no-photo placeholder image
> are Studio › Style controls read with `designNumber()` / `placeholderImage()`. Site name, default
> title/description and share image live in Text & labels › **Site & sharing** and Style › Logo &

> only in the Studio preview (`sampleInPreview`/`sampleHtml`, guarded by `components/noSampleContent.test.tsx`).
> Footer policy link/page titles are Text & labels › Footer (`policyTitle*`).

**Click-to-edit in the preview:** sections carry `data-fm-section`; every other storefront region carries `data-studio-target="style:<groupId>|copy:<Group>|menus:<panel>|pages"` + `data-studio-label`. In Edit mode the preview bridge (`studio/previewBridge.ts`) outlines it, and a click selects that part (`STUDIO_ELEMENT`): the right-hand inspector opens it with **Words · Style · Layout · Visibility** tabs (`studio/elementCatalog.ts` picks the existing controls, `StudioElementInspector.tsx` renders them) — no pop-up menu. **Open in Theme settings** still reaches the full category (`openTarget`). New storefront regions must carry a target — `studioTargets.test.ts` checks every target points at a real panel.

**Category drop-downs:** a shop category can sit under another (`parentId`, Studio › Menus › Shop categories ›
**Sits under**, one level deep — `navItems.ts` `parentOf`/`childCategories`). A parent with sub-categories renders as
`features/site/NavDropdown.tsx` in every header (All + each sub-category); `bookInCategory(book, cat, allCats)` makes a
parent include its sub-categories' books. Books are filed in Books › edit › Organize (chips show `Parent › Child`).
Style › Navigation links has the drop-down controls (`navDropdown*`, `navFlatSubcategories`); the "All" word is
Text & labels › Header (`navDropdownAll`). `/collections/:slug` renders `MainSite` (same header/footer) opened on that
category — the standalone `CollectionPage` is no longer routed.

**One storefront shell:** `MainSite` renders a single Riso header/footer for every view; the Home view swaps the catalog grid for `design.heroPage.sections`. Studio › Sections (Home) › **Show a Home page** toggles `showHero` (off = open straight on the catalog). The legacy hero header/`HeroCarousel` were removed — don't re-add a second header.

**One header & footer (Studio 2.0 · 2.1):** `features/site/StoreHeader.tsx` is the only storefront header and
`features/site/StoreFooter.tsx` the only footer. MainSite passes `shop={…}` (in-page category picking, logo → Home,
masthead layout, logo alignment, sticker pills, transparent header, wishlist count, light/dark toggle, Ctrl/⌘+K);
product and custom pages use page mode (routed links). Wishlist, account, order tracking and 404 render inside
`StoreChrome` (header + footer around the page; its title bar becomes a plain row via `useInStoreChrome`), switched by
Style › Header & announcement bar › **Show the shop header & footer on wishlist, account, order tracking and missing
pages** (`showStoreChromeOnUtilityPages`, default on). Checkout keeps its own `checkoutHeader`. Add header/footer
features there only — `storeChrome.parity.test.tsx` checks every Studio hook against `__fixtures__/storeChromeHooks.json`
and fails if another file renders the navigation `<header>` or `footerPanel`; refresh the fixture
(`UPDATE_STORE_CHROME_HOOKS=1`) only for an intended hook change.

**Shop card title & price:** Studio › Style › **Product cards & grid** has colour, size (desktop + phone), weight, font and letter-spacing controls for the card title and price (`productTitleColor`, `cardTitle*`, `productPriceColor`, `cardPrice*`), plus the boxed-tag and old-price colours. `features/site/cardTypography.ts` turns them into CSS (emitted by `StorefrontThemeStyle`); cards opt in with the `fm-card-title` / `fm-card-price-wrap` / `fm-card-price` / `fm-card-price-tag` / `fm-card-price-old` classes — the shop grid, collection, wishlist, search, related-books and recently-viewed cards and the **Product grid** / **Product showcase grid** sections do. When a Style card colour is set it wins over a section's own colour; empty = the section's colour. Add those classes to any new book card — `features/site/cardClasses.test.tsx` renders every section with sample books and fails on a book title without `fm-card-title`.

**Product page (catalogue card):** `features/site/BookDetail.tsx` renders the Riso "catalogue card" layout —
breadcrumb, thumbnail rail + framed photo + "Fig. n" caption, one bordered buy card (tag, title, price,
stock line | formats, qty, Add to bag, wishlist, share), then Description / Details / Reviews tabs (or
accordions) with Details as a label | value record. Every piece is a Studio › Style › **Product page · buy
card & details** control (`pdp*` keys, turned into CSS by `features/site/productPageStyle.ts`, `fm-pdp-*`
classes); its words are in Text & labels › Product page (`pdp*` copy keys). The old trust-signal lines
(`productTrust*`, `showTrustSignals`) were removed at the owner's request — don't re-add them.

**Every Style control must reach every surface (and the preview iframe):** the card title/price and small-print CSS comes from one place, `features/site/StorefrontOverrides.tsx` (`storefrontOverridesCss`). `StorefrontThemeStyle` renders it, and so do `MainSite`'s `TypographyTokens` and `BookDetail` — any new storefront root that injects its own token `<style>` must render `<StorefrontOverrides>` too. `storefrontOverrides.test.ts` fails on a surface that skips it and on any `STYLE_GROUPS` control that nothing on the storefront reads (wire it or delete it — don't allow-list). Custom code (Style › Custom code) is injected by `features/site/customCode.ts` on public pages only — never in the preview, checkout or admin.

**Photo shapes:** Studio › Style › **Product cards & grid** has **Image shape (proportions)** (12 ratios, 3:4 … 21:9 … 9:16 — `PHOTO_RATIOS` in `features/site/photoShapes.ts`, also used by the Product grid / Product showcase grid / cover carousel sections) and **Image outline** (`photoOutline`: arch, window, pill, circle/oval, leaf, hexagon, octagon, diamond, cut corners, slanted). The product page has its own **Photo shape** / **Photo outline** (`productImageAspect`, `productPhotoOutline`; "Same as shop grid" by default). Outlines are CSS from `photoOutlineCss` (via `StorefrontOverrides`); new photo frames opt in with `fm-photo-frame` (shop cards) or `fm-photo-frame-pdp` (product photos).

**Shopping bag (cart drawer):** `components/CartDrawer.tsx` is a Riso "order slip" — ruled header, free-shipping
meter, numbered line items (photo, title, per-copy price, line total, qty stepper, Remove), "Complete your collection"
card, then Subtotal / Shipping / Total ledger, trust badges and checkout button. Every piece is a Studio › Style ›
**Cart drawer (shopping bag)** control (`cartDrawer*` keys + `showFreeShipBar`/`showCartTrustBadges`; the bar's amount comes from Settings › Shipping,
CSS from `features/site/cartDrawerStyle.ts`, `fm-bag-*` classes); words are Text & labels › Cart. Each region carries
its own click-to-edit target (Bag heading, Free-shipping bar, Bag line items, Bag suggestion, Bag total & checkout).

**Small print:** Studio › Style › **Small print & labels** (`smallPrint*` keys, `features/site/smallPrint.ts`) sets a minimum size, colour, case, letter spacing and font for every tiny `text-[8px]…text-[11px]` label at once.

**Element inspector (1.5):** clicking a built-in part (preview or Page layout) opens it in the right-hand inspector — Words (the strings shown inside it, else its whole Text & labels group), Style, Layout (per previewed device) and Visibility (none for `required` regions). Controls come from `STYLE_TARGET_FIELDS` / the region manifest / its `style:` targets (`elementCatalog.ts`); `elementCatalog.test.ts` fails if a clickable part opens nothing or a style category is unreachable (site-wide ones are `GLOBAL_STYLE_GROUPS`). Theme settings › element focus ("Editing: <label>") still exists via **Open in Theme settings**. Sections get **Content · Style · Layout · Visibility** tabs from `studio/sectionStyleSchema.ts` (`StudioSectionStyle.tsx`; the old hand-written `SectionSettingsPanel` is gone — `sectionStyleSchema.test.ts` pins its keys), including **Hide on tablets** (`hideOnTablet`, 768–1023px).

**Fonts:** Studio › Style › **Typography** has Google Fonts pickers (heading, body, header & menu `navFont`, logo `wordmarkFont`) fed by the curated list in `features/site/fonts.ts` (Riso trio Anton / Archivo / DM Mono first; `googleFontHref` uses only weights each family serves).

**Riso Noir storefront:** the public site defaults to the Riso Press look on black with white text
(`src/app/features/site/risoNoir.ts` → `RISO_NOIR_TOKENS`, `withRisoNoirDefault`; theme-library
preset `lyricalmyrical-riso-noir`). `RISO_STOREFRONT_CSS` in `themeTokens.ts` must stay token-driven
(no literal hex — `themeTokens.test.ts` enforces it). Colour triplet variables (`--fg-rgb`, `--accent-rgb`,
…) are **comma-separated** (`255, 255, 255`) so `rgba(var(--x-rgb), a)` is valid. Every shopper-facing
string goes through `getCopy(design, key)` with a `COPY_SCHEMA` entry (`storeCopy.coverage.test.ts`
guards this); print-treatment knobs live in Colors › **Riso print treatment**, element toggles in
Additional › **Storefront elements**.

**Section contract:** the storefront looks up renderers by the registry `type`
string. A registry type with **no identically named renderer renders nothing**
("added but doesn't show up"). Adding a section = registry schema **+** matching
renderer **+** storefront mapping **+** library entry **+** verify on the live
storefront. Theme data persists as `design` (live, public `settings/website`) and the private
draft in `themes/workspace`, both written only through `admin/themeStore.ts`.

## Deployment

- **Frontend** → GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml` on push
  to `main`. Pages serves under `/LyricalmyricalWebsiteTrial/`, so Vite `base`
  and the router basename are set accordingly (`vite.config.ts`, `App.tsx`).
  Override with `SITE_BASE=/` for a root/custom domain.
- **Firebase** (Firestore rules/indexes, Storage rules, Functions) →
  `.github/workflows/deploy-firebase.yml` (needs `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
  secret), or manually: `npx firebase-tools deploy --only
  firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage,functions`.
- If adding a custom domain, update `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `functions/index.js`
  and OAuth redirect URIs.

### Release banner (removed)

The admin Overview no longer shows a "System status & recent release" card, so there is
nothing to update after a deploy. Don't re-add it unless asked.

## Riso Press admin design system

`src/app/admin/riso/` implements the published **Riso Press design system**
(artifact https://claude.ai/artifact/MvJwSgL7vE4vExRKaC9Gph): newsprint/ink palette, flare
`gold` primary fill with **ink** text (never lighten it), `gold-text` for flare words,
square corners, 2px ink outlines on objects and hairlines inside lists, flat offset
shadows by day, warm-grey night mode, Anton / Archivo / DM Mono, status = glyph + word.
If tokens change there, update `riso.css` to match.

- `riso.css` — semantic `--rp-*` tokens (light + night) and every `rp-*` component
  class; reduced motion, 44px coarse-pointer targets, visible focus, print.
- `components.tsx` — AppShell, Sidebar, Topbar, PageHeader, Breadcrumbs, SectionCard,
  SectionHead, MetricCard, buttons, IconButton, TextField/TextArea/SelectField/
  SearchField, Toggle, Checkbox, StatusBadge, DataTable (row states, sticky head),
  FilterBar, Pagination, Tabs, TabBar, Dialog/Drawer/ConfirmDialog (focus trap, Escape,
  focus restore), `useConfirm()`, ActionMenu, Toast, SyncChip, Empty/Loading/ErrorState,
  SaveBar. `shellParts.tsx` — GlobalSearch, ActivityLogDialog. `nav.ts` — nav config.
- `src/app/lib/useFocusTrap.ts` — shared by admin dialogs and the storefront cart drawer.

**Migrated (built from these components):** shell, Login, Reviews, Activity Logs,
Orders list + detail, Overview, Books catalog, Discounts, Settings › General,
Payments, Shipping (profiles/zones/rates + dialogs), Notifications (+ Inventory sync). `Dashboard.tsx` renders migrated pages
outside the legacy wrapper via its `migrated` flag — add new ones there.

**Overview layout** (`AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`, panels in `Overview{Parts,Sales,Marketing,Customers,Stock}.tsx`):
period control (+ Refresh) → compact **Ready to sell?** strip (`ReadinessStrip`; "N of M ready", only open checks listed,
done ones under *Show completed*, hidden when all pass; `launchReadiness.ts` + `readinessProgress`) → two KPI rows → "To do today" beside
newest orders → Revenue/Traffic chart (every day filled, *Compare with the period before*) → **Dig deeper** tabs
Sales · Marketing & traffic · Customers · Stock. Keep new Overview content inside those groups.
Everything sales-related (revenue net of partial refunds, orders, AOV, **conversion = paid orders ÷ visits**, chart revenue)
comes from real paid non-test orders (`overviewInsights.ts`); the webhook-bumped `analytics.orders/revenue` are not read.
Orders and traffic share calendar-day windows (`periodKeys`, UTC day keys like the `analytics/<date>` docs); all orders/books are
loaded (`getAllOrders`, `getAllBooks`), traffic via `getDailyAnalytics` (400 days). Traffic maths is in `overviewTraffic.ts` (pure, tested).
Marketing/Customers/Stock load carts and back-in-stock sign-ups only when opened.
**Storefront signals** (`funnelApi` in `lib/commerce.ts`, guarded by `lib/trackingGuard.ts`: analytics consent, not Studio preview, not a signed-in
admin): daily `analytics/<date>` docs get `increment()` merges for `visits`, `funnel`, `categoryViews` plus `sources`, `devices`
(from `trackSession`), `bookViews` (`trackProductView`) and `searches`/`noResults` (`trackSearch`, personal-looking terms dropped via
`cleanSearchTerm`). `firestore.rules` caps those maps and lets only the admin read `analytics`. **Deploy rules before the frontend.**
New panels say "Not recorded yet" until data exists — never a made-up zero.

**Not yet rebuilt** (still legacy markup, styled by the scoped compatibility layer in
`theme.css` under `.admin-reso[data-admin-theme="reso"]`, which maps old dark utilities
and violet/blue accents onto Riso tokens): Taxes/Communications
(not in the nav), the Book editor's layout (it does have a dialog for unsaved changes,
a `beforeunload` guard and an inline validation summary), and the theme editor's panels.
Never wrap `rp-*` chrome in `.admin-light` — its `aside button` / `input` rules override
it. Don't add new compat rules for new work; compose the components instead.

## Verification

- **CI** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs `pnpm test`, `pnpm run typecheck`, `vite build` and the Studio browser
  checks (`pnpm run test:studio`) on every PR.
- **Studio fixture:** `pnpm dev` then open `/studio-fixture.html` — the real Studio with in-memory data
  (`studio/fixture/fakeStudioApi.ts`; writes are recorded in `window.__studioFixture.calls`, nothing reaches
  Firestore). `pnpm run test:studio` drives it in Chromium (`CHROMIUM_PATH` to reuse an installed browser,
  `STUDIO_SHOTS=dir` for screenshots). Extend `scripts/studio-e2e.mjs` when Studio behaviour changes.
  `pnpm run typecheck` (`scripts/typecheck-ratchet.mjs`) fails when any file gains type errors over
  `scripts/typecheck-baseline.json`; after fixing errors run it with `--update` to lower the baseline.
- `npm test` (vitest, node env): includes the registry/renderer parity test, nav,
  discount-state, order-status/CSV, cart-quantity and the **theme draft/publish
  separation** test (Firestore mocked) — a draft/discard must never write `design`.
- `tsconfig.json` (strict off, `noEmit`) exists for type-checking only; Vite does not use it.
- Use `pnpm install` (the lockfile pins `react`/`react-dom` 18.3.1, which are optional peer deps —
  a plain `npm install` leaves them out). Vitest also runs `functions/*.test.js`, so run
  `npm ci` in `functions/` first.
- Older page-level visual checks used a throwaway harness that mounts a page with mocked
  `adminApi` data (not committed). Screenshots: `docs/screenshots/riso/`.

## Security notes

- **Secret keys live only in admin-only `adminSecrets/*`** (`stripe`: `secretKey`/`testSecretKey`,
  `resend`: `apiKey`, `gmail`: `appPassword`). `admin/privateKeys.ts` strips them from every
  `settings/website` / `settings/notifications` write (`adminApi.updateSettings`, `saveNotificationSettings`);
  the UI only sees `*Stored` flags. Opening Settings moves any legacy public copy automatically.
  Functions read `adminSecrets` first (`withPrivateStripeKeys`, `readAdminSecret`), then legacy settings, then
  Functions secrets. Keys ever entered before this change were public — rotate them.

## Conventions & gotchas

- Path alias `@` → `src/` (see `vite.config.ts`).
- `figma:asset/...` imports resolve to `src/assets/` via a custom Vite plugin;
  `ImageWithFallback` in `components/figma/` handles broken images.
- The site lives under a sub-path on GitHub Pages — be careful with absolute
  paths/links; prefer router-relative navigation and `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`.
- Money/checkout logic is security-sensitive: never trust client-computed totals
  for the authoritative charge — the Stripe session/webhook path is the source
  of truth.
- shadcn/ui components in `src/app/components/ui/` are generated primitives;
  prefer composing them over hand-rolling new UI.
- Tests live next to source as `*.test.ts` (e.g. `features/site/*.test.ts`).

## Your job after every change
After completing any code enhancement, end your turn with a short "Next moves" list: 5 genuinely high-value suggestions for improving the app, ranked best-first.
Each suggestion is one or two lines:
- **What** — a concrete, specific action (e.g. "Debounce the catalog search box" instead of "improve performance").
- **Why** — the payoff (e.g. a sale not lost, a faster screen, a bug avoided).
- **Effort** — quick / medium / larger.

Then offer to do the top one right away.

### What makes a suggestion good here
- Tied to what just changed. First ask yourself: did this edit open an edge case, risk a lost or wrong save, or leave an obvious next step? Lead with that.
- High-leverage, not generic. Skip boilerplate best-practice filler.
- Specific. Name the file, function, or screen.
- Honest. If nothing is genuinely worth doing, say "nothing pressing" and stop.
- No repeats. Don't re-pitch anything already declined this session.

### Constraints every suggestion must respect
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - **Stack:** React 18 + TypeScript + Vite single-page app; no new frameworks or servers.
> - **Serverless Backend:** Firebase (Firestore, Auth, Storage, Cloud Functions) and static hosting on GitHub Pages. No server or secret keys in client code.
> - **Shopper safety:** never weaken checkout, payment, inventory or webhook authority.

### Angles worth scanning each time
Bug / edge case the change introduced · the next logical feature · draft/publish & save robustness · Firestore data integrity · the speed of a slow screen · keeping catalog and ledger consistent.

## Pull Requests
- When asked for "a new pull request", "new PR", or similar: **create it immediately** from the current branch.
- Do NOT investigate merge status, git history, or ask clarifying questions.
- Action: Push branch with `git push -u origin <branch>` then create PR via GitHub MCP.
- Use a descriptive PR title based on the feature/fix being implemented.
- **After a PR is merged, start the next change on a brand-new branch and open a new PR** — never push commits onto a merged branch to revive it.

## General Principles
- Prefer action over investigation when intent is clear.
- If the user asks for something, assume they know what they want.
- Only ask clarifying questions if the request is genuinely ambiguous.

## Studio organization

Studio organization milestone: Page layout, Theme settings, Text & labels, Navigation and Pages
use readable navigation with page context. Theme settings and text browse by category; search spans
categories and Find anything/click-to-edit opens the owning category. The page outline searches
section and nested-block content, expands matching sections, numbers original positions and offers
Expand/Collapse all and explicit Move up/down actions. Section reorder is disabled while searching to preserve the complete stack.
The toolbar keeps page/device, undo/redo, draft state, Save draft and Publish visible; Theme actions
holds preview, history, checks and guarded discard. Inspector device context distinguishes shared
content from responsive layout overrides. Existing draft/publish persistence is unchanged.

**Friendlier settings homes (October 2026).** `studio/settingsMap.ts` (pure, tested) decides *where* controls
appear; it never adds or removes one. Theme settings opens in three bands (`THEME_HEADINGS` `band`):
**Site-wide design** (presets, logo, colours, typography, small print, buttons, layout, motion, Riso — the design
system), **Parts of your shop** (Header, menu & footer · Shop & book pages · Bag, checkout & accounts · Pages &
features) and **Advanced** (folded **Fine-tune single elements** + Custom code). Part cards have **Show on page**
(`CATEGORY_PAGES` names the preview page or pop-over; Studio opens it and selects the part from the structure scan). Each category card has a one-line description (`GROUP_BLURBS`)
and a **● N changed** badge. **Theme presets & saved themes** and **Payment icons** are categories now
(`EXTRA_STYLE_CATEGORIES`; click-to-edit `style:paymentIcons` opens it). Big categories split into short collapsible
sub-sections (`STYLE_SUBSECTIONS`; unlisted keys fall into **More settings**, so a new control always shows);
Find anything opens the sub-section holding the field (`fieldFocus`). Fields that differ from the default
design show **Changed from default** + **Reset to default**, and **What I've changed** lists them all.
Text & labels uses the same home (`TEXT_HEADINGS`, `TEXT_BLURBS`, "Text I've changed"); long groups (Checkout,
Order tracking, Customer account, Product page, Cart) open as short sub-sections (`TEXT_SUBSECTIONS`, regex by key,
leftovers in **More words**; a new key always shows). Find anything indexes region fields once (desktop entry,
tagged tablet/phone) instead of per device. Page layout shows
**Add section**, **Auto-fit page for phones** and a **Section tools** menu (copy / paste / save for reuse);
saved sections are picked from Add section › **Your saved sections**. A dismissible **How Studio works** card
(Theme actions › Show Studio tips) orients first-time use. `settingsMap.test.ts` fails if any Style category,
text group or field stops being reachable — place new STYLE_GROUPS / COPY_SCHEMA groups under a heading.

## Public storefront readiness repairs (2 October 2026)

Public product links retain unique slugs and use immutable book IDs when slugs collide; catalog records are never rewritten. The storefront reads the entire paginated catalog and the sitemap uses the same route resolver. Unknown URLs show editable recovery content. Custom pages share the support/policy footer, with **Show page footer** in Studio > Style > Custom pages.

Phone navigation is a keyboard-accessible disclosure shared by the homepage and standalone page/product header. Studio > Style > Header & announcement bar > **Show phone navigation** controls visibility; existing header visibility controls apply inside it. Studio > Text & labels > Header > **Mobile menu** controls its label. Missing-page visibility controls live in Style > Custom pages; words remain in Text & labels > Custom pages & 404.

Checkout rejects placeholder/wrong-mode publishable keys and disables payment until an inline Stripe Element is ready. Teardown is idempotent and exception-safe. Admin payment readiness reports invalid keys. Server totals and webhook-only Stripe-paid-order/inventory authority are unchanged. A production payment is still unverified until the owner configures valid Stripe credentials and completes a sandbox order, webhook, refund, email and fulfillment walkthrough. Public placeholder content still needs owner review.


## Publisher fulfillment desk (2 October 2026)

Orders reads the full paginated catalog of orders and private `order-operations` records.
Queues: Needs attention, Ready to pack, Ready to ship, In transit, Completed, Unpaid and All orders; oldest first.
Address review, country/province diagnostics, customer-confirmed corrections, item packing checklists, holds,
parcel presets (browser-local), batch packing with individual results, combined pick lists and separate packing slips
prepare orders for explicit tracked dispatch. Labels never dispatch an order. Terminal/refunded orders cannot be prepared.
Payment remains webhook-controlled; the order detail no longer offers Mark as paid. New internal notes and operational
history live in admin-only `order-operations`, never the guest-readable order. Older public activity is not migrated.
Private document ID reads and collection listing need no composite indexes. Deploy Firestore rules before the frontend.
Deploy updated Functions with the frontend: label requests recheck preparation and claim money-spending purchases
transactionally; uncertain purchase failures stay locked for Shippo reconciliation to prevent duplicate charges.
Address correction is disabled after label purchase. Stripe totals, inventory and refund authority are unchanged.

## Fulfillment workspace UX repair (2 October 2026)

Order detail uses one sequential FulfillmentWorkbench: shipping address, books to pack, shipping/dispatch.
Only the current step exposes its primary action; completed address details expand in place. Parcel setup
and tracked dispatch use focused Riso dialogs; preset naming is collapsed. Holds and refunds are under
More order actions, with refund details and explicit final confirmation. Customer/payment summaries are
secondary; activity and internal notes are collapsed. Phones render order cards and a Work queue selector,
with Filter & sort in a dialog. Batch packing asks for confirmation and retains per-order outcomes.
The private operations, label purchase safeguards, payment authority and server data contracts are unchanged.

### Public designer coverage (2 October 2026)

Wishlist, Customer account and Order tracking have Studio canvases and section stacks. `features/site/storefrontRegions.ts` owns the public region manifest, responsive styling and click-to-edit hooks; its categories are generated in `studio/styleSchema.ts`. Attach `regionProps` in every supported renderer layout when adding optional public elements. Required commerce/consent regions support presentation controls without hide toggles. Merge page-only regions with root settings, preserve product overrides over catalog defaults, and keep phone overrides in `autoFitRegions`. `docs/THEME_EDITOR.md` records the page-by-page ownership and authenticated/live verification limits. Local validation reasons and public order statuses use Text & labels; provider diagnostics must not bypass editable recovery copy.

## Checkout carrier delivery estimates

Live checkout shipping quotes preserve Shippo `estimated_days` and `duration_terms` for each
customer address, parcel and service. Missing carrier timing has no invented 3-7 day fallback.
Checkout displays carrier transit estimates after dispatch rather than calculating an arrival
promise from the order date; carrier terms stay separate from numeric days. Labels for transit
and unavailable timing are editable in Studio > Text & labels > Checkout. Static profile estimates
retain their existing Studio-controlled presentation. Deploy the updated `getShippoRates` Function
with the frontend. Live carrier response verification is separate from fixture-based tests.


## Responsive public element editing (4 October 2026)

Studio > Theme settings groups built-in public elements in a searchable element browser,
including hidden elements and conditional states. Selecting one opens only that element's
controls for the active desktop/tablet/phone preview, with an Edit words shortcut. Spacing
on each side, margins, dimensions, borders, typography, colors, optional visibility and
supported image cropping/grid columns are editable at each size. Tablet inherits desktop;
phone inherits tablet. Per-field resets and Reset size styling remove overrides in one
undoable draft change; All pages / This page only retain unrelated region settings.
Auto-fit for phones includes side spacing and uses tablet values where provided.
Required purchase, consent and recovery controls have presentation controls without hide
switches. Responsive visibility preserves the element's original flex/grid display.
Newsletter heading/description/form/button/status, search input/close/result rows/covers,
and individual review titles/body/authors/dates/states have explicit click-to-edit regions.
Text & labels displays effective defaults, preserves intentionally blank copy, and offers
Reset to default. Inline text uses the same page-aware writer so stale page copy cannot
shadow the new value. Copy changes preserve unrelated labels on other pages.
Local fixture checks do not certify authenticated Firestore publishing or live commerce.

Preview canvases retain their selected viewport width (1200px desktop, 820px tablet,
390px phone) in a scrollable canvas, so narrow editor windows cannot activate the
wrong breakpoint while the owner edits a different device.

## Storefront bundle (9 October 2026)

The shopper entry bundle must stay free of Firebase Auth, the full Firestore SDK and `admin/api.ts`.
Storefront reads/writes use **Firestore Lite** (`lib/firestoreLite.ts` `liteDb` + functions from
`firebase/firestore/lite` — never mix its refs/snapshots with the full SDK) via `lib/publicApi.ts`
(books, settings, pages, shipping profiles, visits; `adminApi` re-exports these). Admin, Checkout and
Account keep the full SDK from `lib/firebase.ts`. Shopper code that needs the signed-in user calls
`restoredUser()` / `loadAuth()` from `lib/authSession.ts`, which loads Auth only when the browser may hold a
saved sign-in. Storefront animations use `m.*` from `motion/react` under the `LazyMotion` +
`MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` wrapper in `App.tsx` (engine in `lib/motionFeatures.ts`, domAnimation:
no layout/drag); don't put CSS `transition-all`/`transition-transform` on an element motion animates.
The prerender blocks Lite's REST writes (`documents:commit`). Check with `npx vite build`: the `index-*.js`
entry was ~205 KB gzipped after this change.

## Storefront loading performance (4 October 2026)

Storefront components share one catalog/settings/published-pages bootstrap request, including
in-flight loads and route remounts. Successful display data is reused for 30 seconds; the next
mount after that refreshes it. Failed requests remain retryable and session-cached content
stays visible during refresh. The session cache is read only when a hook mounts, rather than
on every render. Studio snapshots still override backend data. Authoritative checkout prices,
stock validation and webhook payment handling are unchanged.


## Stripe checkout payment section (4 October 2026)

Checkout inserts `features/site/StripePaymentSection.tsx` with Stripe's actual
Payment Element fields inside the page. The method radio label is separate from
those interactive fields. Payment requires a valid mode-matched publishable key
and an Element-ready event. Missing/invalid keys block payment; they never route
to hosted Checkout. Legacy `stripeRedirect` design values are ignored and the
redirect control is removed from Studio. Failed/stalled loading offers an inline
Reload payment form action before a payment attempt; the form stays on checkout.
Studio > Style > Checkout · Stripe payment section owns responsive panel,
selector, card badges and recovery layout; required payment/recovery controls
cannot be hidden. Text & labels > Checkout owns all labels, badge text and retry
copy. Existing form background, padding, radius and fonts continue to apply.
Server totals and webhook-only Stripe-paid-order/inventory authority are unchanged.
Checkout submission locks synchronously before asynchronous field validation,
disables payment-method switches while processing, and retains the lock during
provider navigation. Failed validation/service calls release it for correction.
Actual field display can be verified without submitting a payment; authenticated
sandbox payment, webhook, refund and email verification remain separate.

Stripe field appearance follows Studio checkout field background, text, border, font, accent and corner-radius controls inside the secure iframe. Riso defaults use square, visibly outlined idle fields with accent focus outlines and danger outlines for invalid fields; payment tabs share the same border treatment.


## Book SEO pane (5 October 2026)

Catalog > Edit book > Search (SEO) owns `metaTitle`, `metaDescription` and optional
HTTPS `seoImage`, saved with the book through the existing admin-only write path.
A custom search title is used exactly; blank fields use catalog content and the
published Studio Site & sharing defaults. The pane previews the effective title,
plain-text description, collision-safe canonical URL and sharing image, and offers
content checks, catalog-default reset and a deployed-URL Rich Results Test link.
Checks are guidance, not a ranking score. Catalog copy and URLs are never bulk rewritten.

`lib/bookSeo.ts` supplies book metadata and Product + Book JSON-LD. The public
PDP uses its displayed currency, price and selected-edition availability, including
backorders. No reviews/ratings are fabricated. `lib/seo.ts` updates canonical and
social URLs on router navigation, strips query/fragment parameters, clears stale
sharing images, and marks previews and private account/checkout/tracking pages noindex.
`index.html` has no fixed homepage canonical that conflicts with product routes.

`build:sitemap` lists published book/page routes, escapes URLs and removes personal
pages. Book/page fetch failures fail the build instead of silently dropping their
URLs; the optional legacy collections endpoint may be unavailable and is reported.
Robots paths follow the deployment sub-path; Google reads robots.txt at the origin
root, so a project-folder robots.txt alone is not an origin-wide crawl restriction.
Private pages also use noindex metadata. Rebuild/deploy the sitemap when catalog
routes change. No new Firestore collection, rule, index or Function is required.

Verification covers focused SEO regression tests, the complete Vitest suite,
production build with public catalog reads, and local desktop/phone fixture checks
for preview/edit/save/reset and rendered PDP metadata. Fixture save evidence is not
live Firestore persistence. Google rankings/indexing and a live Rich Results Test
remain external verification. GitHub Pages still uses its existing SPA 404 redirect;
server-rendered HTML with direct 200 product routes remains a future crawlability
improvement. After deployment submit the sitemap and inspect URLs in Search Console.

## Discount codes: start date and one-use-per-customer (6 October 2026)

Discounts › New/Edit has an optional **Start date** (code is refused server-side until that day; a **Scheduled**
tab lists them). **One use per customer** is now enforced by `assertDiscountNotUsedByCustomer` in
`functions/index.js` (paid orders with the same code + email; checkout lower-cases `customer.email`
on the order). Both checks run in `fetchValidDiscount` / both checkout paths; totals and webhook authority are unchanged.

## Customer bug sweep (6 October 2026)

- **Prices:** USD/EUR shoppers see the CAD price × today's rate everywhere (`CurrencyContext`), which is what the
  server charges. Stored `usdPrice`/`eurPrice` are reference-only (Books › edit › Pricing says so). `catalogUnitPrice`
  in `CartContext.tsx` mirrors the server's unit-price rule. A sale price counts only when it is above 0, and a variant
  with no price can't be added. One-click adds (wishlist, bag suggestion, "Add both") pick an in-stock edition via
  `features/site/buyable.ts`.
- **Checkout shipping:** until the shopper picks a rate, the best current quote stays selected, including after the
  address changes the quotes. With no option selected, the summary shows Text & labels › Checkout › `coShipChoose`
  instead of "Free". The IP country lookup only fills a form nobody has touched yet. BOGO "% off" uses `bogoPercent`
  (client `checkoutFulfillment.ts`, server `functions/localFulfillment.js`): missing means 100.
- **Abandoned carts:** `firestore.rules` limits browser writes to the cart fields and blocks `notified*`, and a
  recovered cart can't be reopened. `abandonedCartSweep` rebuilds items and prices from `books`, escapes the text,
  skips carts older than 7 days and throttles to one reminder per address every 3 days (`abandoned-cart-throttle`,
  server-only). Deploy rules and functions together.
- Order tracking accepts `#`/spaces in order numbers (`features/site/orderNumber.ts`).

## Bug sweep #2 (6 October 2026)

- **Payment integrity:** checkout accepts only CAD/USD/EUR (`functions/paymentGuards.js`). Stripe and PayPal store
  `expectedAmountMinor`/`expectedCurrency` when the payment is created, and the webhook/capture marks an order paid
  only on an exact match. A mismatch sets `paymentMismatch` and the order shows in Orders › Needs attention.
- **Stock** changes go through `functions/inventory.js` (`readBooks`/`writeStock`), one write per book, so two
  editions in one order both count. Oversells set `oversold: true`.
- **Buyable books:** the server refuses draft, archived and future-dated books, and bare lines for books sold in
  editions (`purchaseProblem`). The storefront shows only `isLiveBook` books (`features/site/liveBook.ts`, also used by
  the sitemap) outside a real Studio preview. Order item names come from the catalog.
- **Emails:** `compileEmailTemplate` HTML-escapes every value except `items_table`. Manual-payment instructions come from
  settings, not the order.
- **Checkout:** tax uses `features/site/taxRate.ts` (same matching as the server). E-book-only carts ask only
  country/province. A server-refused discount is removed with its reason (`coDiscountRejected`). PayPal has its own
  option (`coPaypalOption`). A failed PayPal capture returns to checkout. Discount dates follow the Toronto calendar day.
- **Consent:** `lib/consent.ts` `consentAllows()`. Declined analytics stops funnel/visit/referral tracking and custom code.
  Declined marketing stops abandoned-cart capture.
- Section links typed as `/path` get the site sub-path (`siteHref`). Category nav memoises on content. Untracked
  inventory never shows SOLD OUT.

## Crawlable public HTML

**Richer book listings (8 October 2026):** Book JSON-LD adds `bookFormat`, `numberOfPages`, `datePublished`, `bookEdition` (selected edition wins) and `gtin13` (only a check-digit-valid ISBN-13, `isbn13`) — blank fields are omitted. Fallback meta descriptions end on a word (`snippet`); custom ones stay exact. `useSEO` sets `max-image-preview:large` on indexable pages, drops empty `og:image`/`twitter:image` (card falls back to `summary`), adds `og:image:alt`, optional `product:price:*`/`product:availability` (PDP passes `product`), and removes index.html's no-JS fallback `#seo-jsonld-static`. PDP photos use each photo's Media alt text, falling back to Text & labels `bookPhotoAlt`.

**Rich results (October 2026):** pages emit one JSON-LD `@graph` — home BookStore+WebSite, book Product/Book + breadcrumb + star rating from approved reviews only (`reviewsApi.listApproved`, shared with the reviews section), collection CollectionPage/ItemList, page breadcrumbs (`lib/bookSeo.ts`, `docs/SEO_CRAWLABILITY.md`). The sitemap lists book photos as `image:image`.

Production builds render the public sitemap into real HTML route documents via
`scripts/prerender-storefront.mjs` (see `docs/SEO_CRAWLABILITY.md`). Home, book,
custom-page and collection routes use the actual published storefront DOM;
account, wishlist, checkout, tracking and admin routes are excluded. Chromium is
installed by the Pages workflow. Snapshots update on deployment; rerun Pages
after publishing catalog or Studio changes. Browser storage and settings objects
are never serialized; render-time Firestore writes/analytics are blocked. Payment
and inventory authority remain live and unchanged. Install Chromium locally with
`pnpm exec playwright install chromium` before `npm run build`.

Public SEO/catalog pagination uses document IDs so records without `createdAt` are included consistently with the sitemap. Admin sorting is unchanged. HTML builds decline analytics/marketing consent and require completed custom-page content.

## Paid-but-unpaid recovery + Riso order tracking (6 October 2026)

- `markStripeOrderPaid` (functions/index.js) applies Stripe paid-order mutations only when called by
  `stripeWebhook` after signature verification (stock, discount usage, downloads, analytics and amount checks,
  idempotently). Status requests require an authorized customer/admin identity or the order's private access key;
  they retrieve that order's saved Stripe payment and record `reconciliationPending` when provider evidence
  indicates payment. The 15-minute `unpaidPaymentSweep` records the same evidence and alerts the owner.
  Neither path marks a Stripe order paid or changes stock, discount usage or revenue. Review webhook health
  and resend the signed Stripe event before fulfillment. PayPal, manual/offline and free-order paths remain available.
- Order tracking (`features/site/OrderTracking.tsx`) is a Riso order slip (`features/site/trackingStyle.ts`,
  `fm-track-*`, token-only). An unpaid Stripe order re-checks automatically and offers **Check payment again**
  (Text & labels › Order tracking › `trackRecheck`, `trackRechecking`, `trackStillUnpaid`).

## Stripe ↔ shop payment sync hardening (6 October 2026)

- `functions/stripeRecovery.js` (pure, tested): `modesToTry` looks up an order's payment in the Stripe account it
  was created in (`order.stripeMode`) and then the other one — sandbox orders used to be checked with the live key
  and silently stayed unpaid. `retrieveOrderPayment` in `index.js` is used by the status check and the sweep.
- `stripeWebhook` verifies against the Functions secret **and** endpoint secrets saved in admin-only
  `adminSecrets/stripeWebhook` (`live`/`test`), and settles any `payment_intent.succeeded` carrying
  `metadata.order_id` (either checkout path). It records `adminSecrets/stripeWebhookStatus` (last event / last signature failure).
- `unpaidPaymentSweep` runs every 15 minutes (orders 10 min–7 days old), records pending Stripe reconciliation
  and alerts the owner; only a verified webhook settles the order.
- Settings › Payments › Stripe › **Webhook health** (`admin/StripeWebhookHealth.tsx`, action `webhookHealth`) checks the
  endpoint, **Fix webhook** adds missing events / re-enables / creates it, **Reset webhook signing** recreates it when
  signatures fail. Opening an unpaid Stripe order in Orders asks Stripe automatically; **Check payment with Stripe**
  repeats the evidence check without marking it paid.

**Admin alerts:** `admin/adminAlerts.ts` (pure, tested) turns the orders feed + `adminSecrets/stripeWebhookStatus`
into banners shown above every admin page (`AdminAlerts.tsx`, rendered in `Dashboard.tsx`, refreshed with the
Orders badge every 5 minutes): payment/amount mismatch, unpaid after a started Stripe payment (>10 min), disputes,
rejected webhooks, oversold, paid orders waiting >3 days to ship, manual payments pending >2 days. Test orders are
ignored. Dismiss hides one for the browser session until a new order joins it.

## Collection indexing (7 October 2026)

Collection pages with no published, released books receive `noindex, follow` and are
omitted from the sitemap. Empty visible Studio categories remain in the prerender
route list so their initial HTML carries the same instruction. Search, sort and stock
filters do not change indexing; sold-out books still count. Renamed category URLs
canonicalize to current names. `categoryMembership.mjs` shares alias, parent and
PUBLICATIONS membership between navigation and sitemap generation. Published and
activated scheduled Studio designs remain authoritative; draft categories stay private.

## Automatic SEO refresh and catalog search controls

The Pages workflow checks published Firestore catalog/pages/settings every 15 minutes,
compares the published-content SHA-256 marker, and rebuilds only on a change. Draft-only
Studio edits do not trigger refreshes; scheduled release visibility does. Push/manual
builds always run. Only successful deployments advance the public digest marker.
Studio visible categories (including visible children) own collection sitemap URLs and
collection SEO copy. Books > Search (SEO) exposes `seoNoindex`: excluded books remain
available to shoppers, receive noindex HTML, and are omitted from the sitemap.
Studio > Text & labels > Site & sharing owns the public Google Search Console verification
token. Google property verification/submission still requires the owner's Search Console access.

**Refund/dispute sync (7 October 2026):** `syncStripeReversal` in `functions/index.js` is the one place a Stripe
refund or dispute changes an order (full refund → refunded/cancelled, stock back, revenue reversed, once; partial
refund → `partiallyRefunded` + `refundedAmountMinor`, stays paid; dispute → `disputeStatus`). It is fed by the
`charge.refunded` / `charge.dispute.*` webhooks **and** by direct Stripe reads (`checkStripeReversal`): the status
action for paid orders (admin order open / **Sync with Stripe**) and `unpaidPaymentSweep`, which re-reads paid Stripe
orders (≤120 days) at most every 6 h (`ordersDueReversalCheck`, `stripeCheckedAt`).

## Payments & shipping panel repair (7 October 2026)

- **Sandbox payments** (`session.livemode === false` / `stripeMode: "test"`, PayPal `paypalMode: "test"`) mark the
  order `isTest: true, sandboxPayment: true` and never touch stock, discount usage or revenue — on payment or refund
  (`functions/sandboxPayment.test.js`). `onOrderUpdated` still emails sandbox orders so the rehearsal covers email.
- **Stripe keys:** `SecretField` passes every edit up (clearing cancels), refuses wrong-slot keys
  (`stripeSecretKeyProblem`), and offers **Remove stored key** (`adminApi.removeStripeSecretKey`). Saves return
  true/false (`Dashboard.saveSection`), and saved secrets are scrubbed from screen state (`scrubSavedSecrets`).
  The "secret in public settings" blocker only fires on a real leak (`publicSecretLeak`). Test mode without a test
  secret key blocks; live without a stored key warns.
- **Test connection** (action `verifyStripeKeys`) and **Webhook health** (`webhookHealth`, verdicts in
  `admin/stripeChecks.ts`): per-mode delivery status, signing-secret presence (`STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is declared
  on `createStripeCheckoutSession`), processing failures, signature failures recorded only for real Stripe-signed
  requests, reset clears old failures and asks first. Checkout refuses a payment whose server `stripeMode` differs
  from the card form's publishable key.
- **Shipping:** zones store ISO codes (`toCountryCodes`); both engines match names too. `functions/shippingGeo.js` is
  generated from `shippingZones.ts` COUNTRIES (`shippingGeo.parity.test.ts`). Profile rules persist. Quote ids are
  unique per option. A zone-less profile offers nothing once any profile has zones. Live rates resolve countries
  with `resolveCountry` and fall back to profile rates when Shippo has none; `SHIPPO_API_TOKEN` is declared on both
  checkout functions. Product assignment sends explicit removals; the panel reads the whole catalog (`getAllBooks`).

**Order emails (7 October 2026):** one order = one customer email ("Order confirmed", `order_confirmation`, on paid)
and one shop email (`[NEW ORDER] <id> · paid …`, `new_order_admin`, on paid, `[TEST]` prefix for sandbox) with a
**Fulfil this order** button to `/admin#orders/<id>`. `onOrderCreated` emails the shop only for manual-payment
(`pending`) orders. Card payments send no Stripe receipt (`receipt_email` removed); Stripe's own "successful payments"
customer email must also be off in the Stripe dashboard. `functions/orderEmails.test.js` pins this.

**Orders desk (7 October 2026):** Admin › Orders is an inbox-style split view (`admin/OrdersDesk.tsx`, logic in
`ordersDesk.ts`, tested): list on the left (search; **Needs me** / **Shipped** / **All**; test orders hidden unless
toggled), the full `OrderDetail` on the right — so Stripe sync, refunds, disputes, labels and dispatch are unchanged —
with the oldest order that needs work opened automatically and finishing an order moving to the next (`goToNext`).
`OrderDetail` reports reloads via `onChanged` so the list refreshes. Phones show list *or* order. **Table view** opens the
previous `Orders` table (bulk packing, pick lists, CSV). Email links `/admin#orders/<id>` still open that order.
The packing checklist shows each book's current cover and **Shelf location** (Books › edit › Inventory, `shelfLocation`,
per edition when set; `packingInfo` in `fulfillment.ts`). Books are public-readable, so the shelf code is too.

## reCAPTCHA / App Check

Invisible reCAPTCHA Enterprise initializes before Firestore/Auth in src/lib/firebaseApp.ts.
Use functionFetch from src/app/lib/functionsBase.ts for every browser HTTP Function
request and onBrowserRequest in functions/index.js for its server handler. Keep signed
provider webhooks and emailed digital-download links outside browser attestation.
APP_CHECK_MODE defaults to monitor; enforce only after registering the public site key,
verifying traffic, and completing the rollout in docs/RECAPTCHA.md. Direct Firestore
protection requires separate Firebase App Check console enforcement. Verification
failure copy lives in Studio > Text & labels > Site & sharing. Tokens, debug credentials
and provider diagnostics must never be logged or saved to public settings.

**Maximum discount cap (7 October 2026):** Discounts › New/Edit › **Maximum discount (CA$)** (`maxDiscountAmount`, blank = no cap)
limits what one code can take off an order ("20% off, up to $15"). The server enforces it in `computeDiscountAmount`
(`capDiscountAmount`, `functions/index.js`); `Checkout.tsx` mirrors it for display only. Shown as a **Max … off** badge in the list.

## Bug sweep #3 — ready for sales (7 October 2026)

- **Refunds:** `applyOrderRefund` (functions/index.js) is the one place an order becomes refunded — admin refunds
  (Stripe, PayPal captures API, or manual via `refundProviderOf`), Stripe Dashboard refunds, lost disputes and PayPal
  `PAYMENT.CAPTURE.REFUNDED/REVERSED` webhooks. Stock (admin's `refundRequest.restock`), discount use and revenue are
  reversed once; `refund_pending` completes later via the reversal sweep.
- **Payments:** PayPal request ids include amount+currency; a late `async_payment_failed` can't undo a paid order;
  a second Stripe payment is kept in `duplicatePayments` and alerted (Orders shows "Paid twice"); a card retry
  cancels the order's previous unfinished PaymentIntent; hosted sessions save `stripeCheckoutSessionId` at creation.
- **Orders from browsers:** `firestore.rules` lets guests create only unpaid Stripe/PayPal/Free orders with a fixed
  key list. Every manual-payment order is priced and created by `createManualLocalOrder`. $0 orders use
  `action: "completeFreeOrder"` (server completes only when its own total is 0; `completeOrderWithoutCard`).
- **Checkout:** the bag is repriced against the live catalog (`repriceCart`), Pay waits for the catalog, server
  refusals and card declines are shown, the server total is compared before charging, 99 copies max per line,
  email format checked on both sides. Policy links sit under Pay (Style › `hideCheckoutPolicyLinks`).
- **Email:** customer emails use the paid currency (`functions/emailMoney.js`); manual orders get
  `order_pending_payment`; footers add Settings › General › Location; abandoned-cart reminders honour their switch
  and a signed unsubscribe (`functions/marketingOptOut.js`, `marketing-optout`, `/track?unsubscribe=1`).
- **Other:** ebook downloads need the digital edition; Shippo webhook re-reads status from Shippo; policy pages are in
  the sitemap/prerender; Orders CSV has tax/payment/currency/refund columns (paid/refunded only for whole lists).
- **Not changed on purpose:** rate-limit IP source (verify the real X-Forwarded-For shape first), sales-tax model
  (shipping tax / printed-book rebate need the owner's accountant).

## Bug sweep #4 (7 October 2026)

- **Reviews:** public reads only `status == "approved"`; reviewer emails live in admin-only `reviewContacts/{reviewId}`
  (`reviewsApi.create` writes both; `contactsFor` moves older public emails once per admin session).
- **Signups:** `stockAlerts` ids are `<email>__<bookId>__<variantId>` and `newsletter` ids are the email (both enforced
  in `firestore.rules`), so repeats are refused. `onBookRestocked` sends once per address, skips draft/archived books,
  reclaims sends stuck >15 min and deletes the alert after sending.
- **Emails:** refund amount in the currency refunded (`refundAmountText`); no "won't be charged" email for paid orders;
  shipped email without tracking drops those lines (`withoutTrackingLines`), none for pickup/local delivery.
- **Storefront:** search/wishlist use `isLiveBook`; Canadian time zones start in CAD (`currencyForTimeZone`).
- Signed-in order reads need `email_verified`. Analytics visits can't decrease.

## Readiness fixes from the 5-agent audit (7 October 2026)

- **Payments:** `markOrderPaid` refuses card/PayPal and cancelled orders (`manualPaidRefusal`); checkout refuses cancelled
  orders (`checkoutRefusal`); a payment arriving for a cancelled order is recorded but **not** marked paid
  (`paymentMismatch.paidAfterCancel`, Orders › Needs attention). PaymentIntents use `stripeIntentKey` and hosted sessions a
  per-minute idempotency key, so a double click can't open two live payments. "Paid" is set by the Stripe webhook, the
  server-verified status check / sweep (`markStripeOrderPaid`), the verified PayPal capture, or `completeOrderWithoutCard`
  for manual/$0 orders — never by the browser.
- **Stock holds:** `functions/stockHolds.js` transactionally holds tracked stock for 30 min per order (server-only `stock-holds/{bookId}`)
  before Stripe, PayPal, manual-payment, or free checkout can settle; payment revalidates/renews the hold. Reservation-store failures fail closed;
  expected stock conflicts after a provider capture stay unpaid and raise an inventory-reconciliation alert. Holds release on payment or cancel and expire automatically.
- **Tax gaps:** Overview › Ready to sell lists provinces/states with no matching rate (`uncoveredTaxRegions`).
- **Customer requests:** order tracking has *Ask to cancel / return* (`action: "orderRequest"`, `order.customerRequest`,
  Needs attention + Order detail › Mark request handled) and *Your data* (`action: "privacyRequest"` →
  admin-only `privacyRequests`; Settings › General › **Privacy requests** exports JSON or erases, keeping orders).
  Words: Text & labels › Order tracking (`trackReq*`, `trackPrivacy*`); boxes: Style regions `trackingRequests`/`trackingPrivacy`.
- **Rate limits:** `clientIpOf` takes the right-most non-proxy `X-Forwarded-For` hop (Google appends the real client);
  Shippo rate/address and PayPal create/capture have their own buckets. Deploy rules + functions before the frontend.

## Commerce access, navigation and merchandising (7 October 2026)

Stripe paid-order authority belongs only to the signature-verified webhook. Authenticated or private-key
payment status checks and the payment sweep record pending reconciliation; provider success alone does not
release an unpaid Stripe order for fulfillment. PayPal capture, manual/offline payment and server-validated
free orders remain supported through their existing contracts. Guest order access requires the private order
key; an order number or payment ID alone is not authorization.

Studio > Navigation > Header bar order chooses each published page's Main shopping bar or Publisher navigation
row (`secondaryNavKeys`). Initially, exact Submissions, History, Our history and Open call(s) page titles use the
publisher row; an explicit selection, including an empty list, overrides that grouping. Categories remain in
shopping navigation. Style > Header layout > Show publisher navigation row controls visibility; Text & labels >
Header owns its accessible name. Both header layouts and standalone page/product headers share this hierarchy,
including phones, where search stays directly available under the existing search visibility control.

Books > Categories & tags > Curated recommendations offers automatic category matches or up to four chosen
books in editable display order, with full-catalog search and removal. Saving the book applies the choice; an
empty publisher selection hides recommendations. Public rendering excludes missing, current and unpublished
books without filling a curator's selection with automatic results. Studio's existing related-books visibility
and heading controls still apply. Product details show supplied edition, positive page count, publisher and
publication date; a selected variant's name takes precedence for edition. Show edition details and the four
spec labels live in Studio. Existing contributor display, genuine photo upload, cover order and alt-text fields
remain the content source; owner-supplied photographs and editorial facts are required, never fabricated.

Checkout adds a separate optional apartment/unit field, eligible Stripe express-wallet presentation and a total
beside payment. Studio > Checkout controls their optional visibility and Text & labels owns their words. Wallet
availability depends on Stripe, browser, account and domain eligibility; this change does not prove live wallet
activation. Required payment, validation and server-priced totals remain intact.

Readiness distinguishes payment configuration, contributor/edition metadata and possible test titles from
verified deployment, hosting and email delivery. Admin alerts cover pending payment reconciliation, unresolved
label purchases and recent failed/bounced/complained email attempts, with links to the relevant workspace.
Provider acceptance is distinct from inbox delivery. Local tests and builds do not verify deployment or live
Stripe/PayPal payments, wallet eligibility, webhook delivery, email, refunds or carrier purchases.


## Cart estimates, returns and catalog review (7 October 2026)

The cart offers country/postal-code shipping previews from current server catalog prices,
edition weights and configured shipping profiles. These are preliminary profile estimates;
live carrier prices and eligibility require the full checkout address. They exclude discounts
and tax, never authorize a charge and reset when the cart/destination changes. Session storage
carries the destination into checkout. Matching saved addresses may fill street details;
other saved/recovered destinations cannot overwrite or mix with the selected destination.
Studio > Style > Cart drawer > Total & checkout button owns Show shipping cost preview;
Text & labels > Cart owns its words. Inputs use the shared cart palette and typography.

Orders > Customer return progresses through approval/decline with customer-visible instructions,
parcel receipt, full-order inspection and an explicitly confirmed full-order refund. Mixed-condition
lines record a resellable quantity. Only eligible physical copies restock, once, through the existing
provider/admin-authorized refund path. Approval and receipt never change money or inventory.
Full-order refunds include shipping, tax and digital items; partial financial refunds remain a
separate provider workflow. Cash/e-Transfer refunds must be sent externally before recording them.
Private inspection/actor/history data live in admin-only order-operations.returnCase. A limited
returnProgress summary appears in secure customer tracking with Studio-owned status words and the
existing trackingRequests region controls. Open returns block dispatch/local fulfillment and label
purchases. Stripe paid-order authority remains webhook-only; supported PayPal/manual authority is
unchanged. New endpoints cartShippingPreview and manageReturn use functionFetch and App Check.

Books loads the full catalog. Show books needing publish review flags cover/interior images,
contributor credits, base/sale/edition prices, format/edition/page count, shipping weight, publisher
copy and possible placeholders. Single-book saves to Published and bulk Publish open a reviewed
selection; invalid title/prices block publishing, other warnings require explicit acknowledgement.
Bulk Move to draft previews the chosen records and preserves their content, inventory and order
history. Failed updates remain selected for retry. Publication status controls public routes,
lists, recommendations and sitemap: titles never automatically hide products. Owners must review
and draft currently published test/duplicate records before releasing this visibility change.

Deploy the Functions bundle with the frontend so cart estimates, return transitions and refund
completion agree (including Stripe/PayPal webhooks and reconciliation). Existing books/orders/
order-operations access patterns require no new rules or composite indexes; inspection remains
private. Local handler tests and provider-isolated browser fixtures prove workflow behavior,
not deployed functions, real payment/refund acceptance, carrier rates or email delivery.

## App release notes
Every PR must prepend one entry to `src/app/admin/appUpdates.ts`: stable unique ID, date (YYYY-MM-DD), plain-language title and summary, and shortcuts to the affected admin screens (`tab`, optional `settingsTab`, using IDs from `riso/nav.ts`). Explain user-visible benefits honestly; do not claim a backend deployment or live provider verification from local checks. For maintenance-only PRs, say what reliability changed and link to its relevant workspace. Keep older entries for View all updates. The admin sidebar's What's new box shows the newest entry bundled with the deployed frontend; it is not a live GitHub feed.

Checkout country dropdowns pair option backgrounds and text with Studio's Checkout field colours, including Stripe's Windows dropdown; highlighted Stripe options use contrasting text on the checkout accent.
Stripe payment fields retain Studio colours when readable and choose contrasting black/white text for insufficient-contrast pairs; labels follow the surrounding checkout text.

Custom-page navigation resolves published bodies from useSiteData's shared snapshot, including Studio preview updates. Avoid separate slug fetches that clear the header/content on each link; cold custom-page loading retains the shared header.
Grouped footer navigation defaults to Explore and Participate & connect, with policies in a wrapping row above copyright. Studio > Style > Footer & social links selects grouped/classic layout and group/location/heading visibility; Text & labels > Footer owns headings. Menus > Footer menu can customize automatic links, assign groups, edit destinations/labels, reorder and hide links, preserving sub-links. Contact pages suppress the duplicate automatic email link. Preview click-to-edit and inline copy hooks remain available.

## Bug sweep #5 (8 October 2026)

- **Cancelling:** Orders › **Cancel unpaid order** is server-side (`createStripeCheckoutSession` action `cancelOrder`,
  `cancelRefusal` in `functions/paymentGuards.js`): refused once paid, and it stops the Stripe PaymentIntent / Checkout
  session and releases stock holds. It asks Stripe first and refuses (recording `reconciliationPending`) when Stripe
  already has the money (`stripePaymentTaken`); the sweep keeps checking cancelled orders with a Stripe payment. PayPal capture and `completeFreeOrder` refuse cancelled orders; the PayPal capture
  request id includes the PayPal order id and a matching `paypalOrderId` is the proof (shoppers may return in a new tab).
- **Paid after cancelling / mismatched payments** clear once refunded: a full Stripe refund sets
  `paymentMismatch.resolvedAt`, or the admin presses **Mark refunded** on the order (action `resolvePaymentMismatch`).
  Queues, alerts and the Orders desk ignore resolved mismatches.
- **Disputes:** an open `disputeStatus` puts a paid, not-yet-sent order in Needs attention; dispatch, label purchase and
  local handover refuse it. Sent parcels stay In transit so delivery can still be recorded.
- Manual **Mark paid** after the 30-min hold no longer fails (`completeOrderWithoutCard(…, { reserve: false })`).
  Sweeps read bounded, ordered windows (new `orders` indexes); the "webhook missed" alert skips cancelled/mismatched orders.
- **Discounts** can't exceed the qualifying subtotal; tier percentages are 0–100 (admin refuses > 100%).
  An edition with an empty price can't be saved. Address correction can't change country/province on carrier orders.
- **Checkout:** a retry (card, PayPal, manual or free) releases the shopper's own previous unpaid attempt's hold
  (`previousOrderId`, `releaseSupersededAttempt`: unpaid, same email, and Stripe shows no payment in progress). Pickup choices stay picked. An address-checker outage continues as
  unverified (`addressError: "verification_unavailable"`, shown in the address step of the order). Tax shows its real
  amount (CA$0.00 too) once country and a recognised province are known; unrecognised saved provinces are cleared.
- **Bag free-shipping bar** follows Settings › Shipping (`features/site/freeShipThreshold.ts`): only a rule that makes
  every option free everywhere counts (profile `freeShippingOver` / `freeThreshold`, or `freeOver` on every rate); highest
  across profiles; hidden otherwise or for an e-book-only bag. The Studio
  "Free shipping over" number was removed — Studio keeps the on/off and look.
- Download buttons appear only for digital lines (`features/site/digitalLine.ts`). Review inputs carry the rules' length
  limits. A page missing from the cached site shows Loading until the fresh read (`useSiteData().fresh`), not a 404.
- **Deploy** Firestore indexes + Functions + frontend together. Owner decisions still open: should free-shipping codes
  cover express/live rates, a "change cookie choice" link, and the sales-tax model.
## Bug sweep #6 + shop filters (8 October 2026)

- **Shop filters:** `features/site/CatalogControls.tsx` adds Shopify-style **Format** chips (paperback, hardcover,
  e-book, audiobook, other — from the book's and every edition's format, `bookFormats`), **Price** Min/Max boxes
  (typed in the shopper's currency, `priceRangeFor`) and **Clear filters**. Chips show only when the current view has
  2+ formats and the price boxes only with 2+ prices (`filterView`); a hidden filter never applies (`appliedFilters`).
  "In stock" counts editions and backorders (`bookInStock`); search also matches ISBN. Each piece is a Studio region
  (`catalogFormat`, `catalogPrice`, `catalogClear` — show/hide + layout in Theme settings › Fine-tune single elements › Catalog & shared content · layout);
  words are Text & labels › Search & filters (`filterFormat*`, `filterPrice*`, `filterClear`). The bar itself still
  follows Style › Catalog page header & filters › **Show search, sort & in-stock bar**.
- **Display price:** `features/site/displayPrice.ts` — a book sold only in editions shows its cheapest edition
  (CurrencyContext `getBookPrice`, shop cards, search, showcase grid, filters/sort) instead of CA$ 0.00.
- **Server prices:** `functions/catalogPrice.js` `catalogUnitPrice` mirrors `CartContext.catalogUnitPrice` everywhere
  (a `"0"`/negative sale price is ignored; an edition with no price is refused, never charged $0).
- **Discounts:** `validateDiscountCode` returns `maxDiscountAmount` (checkout showed the uncapped amount);
  `functions/discountPayload.test.js` fails if checkout reads a field the server doesn't send. Every discount is clamped
  to 0…items value on both sides; percent tiers over 100 are refused in the editor. The card-retry key includes the code.
- **Stock holds:** holds carry `owner` (sha256 of the email, `holdOwner`); a shopper's own earlier attempt never blocks
  their retry, other shoppers are still held off.
- **Digital vs physical:** one rule (`isPhysicalItem` / admin `isDigitalItem`) in the cart estimate, returns, label guard
  and publish review — audiobooks/EPUBs/format-only e-books are never shipped, returned or weight-checked.
- **Returns:** a return request the shop hasn't approved can be refunded directly (only approved/received block refunds);
  the workbench offers **Close request without a return**; a closed request can't be reopened; a refund that never reached
  the provider clears its `refundRequest` claim; a lost dispute doesn't show the customer "refund complete"; refunding an
  undispatched order follows the admin's restock choice.
- **Storefront:** `lib/ScrollToTop.tsx` opens each newly clicked page at the top; account data is cleared on sign-out /
  user change (no address carry-over) and order rows/fields are keyboard + screen-reader accessible; product views count
  once; product **Back** goes home when the shopper landed directly; the quantity stepper counts copies already in the bag
  and `addToCart` returns false when nothing was added; Recently viewed updates between books; search overlay traps focus;
  footer icon links have labels (Text & labels › Footer); the grouped legal row hides with no policies; wishlist badges
  count only live books; the cart estimate guesses the country and hands its destination to checkout only after **Estimate**.
- Deploy Functions with this frontend. No Firestore rule or index changes.

## Bug sweep #7 (8 October 2026)

- **Stock on book save:** `adminApi.updateBook(id, form, loaded)` re-reads the book in a transaction and keeps the live
  `stockLevel` / edition stock for any count the owner didn't change (`admin/bookStockMerge.ts` `keepLiveStock`), so a
  sale made while the editor was open is never undone. **Discount edits** never write `usageCount`/`createdAt`
  (server-owned). Duplicate codes are refused in the editor (`validateDiscountDraft(…, otherCodes)`); the server trims
  codes and uses the usable copy when old duplicates exist (`fetchValidDiscount` / `discountProblem`).
- **Display price:** a book sold in editions shows its cheapest edition and never a SALE badge (`displayPrice`,
  `showsSale` in `features/site/displayPrice.ts`) — it's always charged an edition's price. Search/wishlist/sections use it.
- **Backorders:** `backorderable(book)` (CartContext, book-level `allowBackorder` like the server) — no stock cap in
  `addToCart` or the product page quantity. The bag drawer reprices saved lines once the live catalog loads (never in
  preview; lines that can't be bought are left for checkout's notice).
- **Release dates:** a plain `scheduleDate` opens at midnight Toronto (`releaseArrived` in `liveBook.ts`, mirrored in
  `functions/paymentGuards.js` and `scripts/publicStorefrontData.mjs`); admin discount "today" and Expires use the shop day.
- **PayPal:** partial refunds accumulate (`paypalRefundedTotalMinor`, `paypalRefundIds`) and a full total refunds the
  order; capture uses the order's own `paypalMode`. Order emails list download links for every non-physical line
  (`isPhysicalItem`); the shop's paid-order email escapes the address.
- **Admin:** bulk Feature writes `isFeatured`; Approve/Reject selected acts only on visible reviews and the queue loads
  every pending review; Orders CSV includes partial refunds; Overview stock skips `trackInventory: false` books and the
  format mix uses each line's sold edition.
- **Account:** email-link sign-in survives blocked storage; order rows count copies.
- Deploy Functions with this frontend. No Firestore rule or index changes.

## Pre-orders (8 October 2026)

Books › edit › Inventory › **Pre-order** (`preorder: true`) sells a published book before its **Publication date**
(`publishDate`, YYYY-MM-DD, Toronto calendar; empty = "date to be announced"). On release day it becomes an ordinary
book by itself. One rule, `functions/preorder.js` ↔ `features/site/preorder.ts` (`preorder.parity.test.ts`). Stock,
prices, holds and payment authority are unchanged: pre-orders use the book's normal inventory settings (stock caps
pre-orders; backorders or untracked stock = unlimited). Both checkout item builders stamp each line with
`preorder`/`releaseDate` from the catalog (`preorderLine`, a browser flag never sticks). Paid orders with a physical
pre-order line wait in the **Awaiting release** queue (`queueOf`, Orders desk **Pre-orders** tab) until the latest
release date, or until **Ready to ship now** (`fulfillmentAction("release_preorder")` → public `order.preorderReleasedAt` +
`operations.preorderReleased`). Saving a book whose pre-order switch or date changed re-stamps the release date on its
paid, unsent pre-order lines (`restampPreorderItems`, `adminApi.syncPreorderOrders`; switched off = released today);
`dispatchProblem`, local handover and the server `labelProblem` refuse until then. The 3-day ship-late alert and the
daily digest start counting when the printed pre-orders were released (`preorderClockStart`). E-books bought as a
pre-order unlock on release (`downloadDigitalAsset` checks the line and the live book). Order emails get a Pre-order block (`preorderEmailLines`); the shop email subject says `[NEW PRE-ORDER]`.
Storefront: product page stock line + **Pre-order** button, shop-card badge, bag/checkout line notes, a checkout
summary notice (region `checkoutPreorder`), order-tracking note (region `trackingPreorder`), and `PreOrder` +
`availabilityStarts` JSON-LD. Studio: Style › Badges & shop labels › **Pre-order badge** (`showPreorderBadge`), Cart
drawer › **Pre-order note** (`cartDrawerShowPreorder`); words in Text & labels › Product page (`pdpPreorder*`,
`preorderButton`, `preorderBadge`), Cart (`cartPreorder*`), Checkout (`coPreorderNotice*`), Order tracking
(`trackPreorder*`). Mixed bags ship together on the latest release. Deploy Functions with the frontend.

## Gift cards, box sets, automatic discounts, add-ons and scheduled sales (9 October 2026)

All five are priced on the server by **`priceOrder`** (`functions/index.js`), the one price builder every checkout
path uses (card, PayPal, manual, free); `recalculateOrder` and the Stripe handler both call it. Pure rules live in
`functions/promotions.js` (sale windows, add-ons, box sets, gift-card products), `functions/discountMath.js`
(discount arithmetic, automatic choice, free gift) and `functions/giftCards.js` (codes, holds, debit/credit), mirrored
for display in `features/site/promotions.ts` / `discountMath.ts` (`*.parity.test.ts`). Handler tests:
`functions/promotionsCheckout.test.js`, `functions/giftCardSettlement.test.js`.

- **Scheduled sales:** `saleStartsAt` / `saleEndsAt` (plain Toronto dates, inclusive) bound `isOnSale`/`salePrice`
  (`saleActive`); `catalogUnitPrice` on both sides uses it, so badges and charges agree.
- **Paid add-ons:** book `addOns` (≤6: `{id,label,price,kind:"option"|"text",maxLength}`), priced per copy. Cart lines
  carry `addOns` and a line key (different inscriptions = different lines); the server re-prices from the catalog and
  saves `basePrice` + `addOns` (label, price, text) on the line. Never on gift cards or box sets.
- **Box sets:** a book with `bundleItems` (≤20 parts `{bookId,variantId,quantity}`) sells at its own price with no stock
  of its own. Order lines store `components`; `promotions.stockLines` expands them inside `stockChanges`,
  `readBooks` and `linesByBook`, so holds, sales, refunds and inspected returns (`returnRestockItems`) move the real
  books. Available sets = `bundleAvailable` (the storefront derives box-set stock the same way).
- **Automatic discounts:** `discounts` with `method: "automatic"`, `code: ""` and a shopper-facing `title`, loaded by
  `loadAutomaticDiscounts` and never redeemable by code. **One discount per order:** a code replaces automatic offers;
  otherwise the biggest saving wins and free shipping applies only when no money-off offer does
  (`pickAutomaticDiscount`). `type: "gift"` (free gift with purchase: `giftBookId`/`giftVariantId`) adds a
  `promoGift` line from the catalog whose price is the discount; browser-sent gift lines are always dropped. Saved as
  `appliedDiscount { id, code: null, automatic: true, title }`, counted like codes. Checkout reads offers via
  `validateDiscountCode` `{ action: "automaticDiscounts" }`.
- **Gift cards:** a book with `productType: "giftCard"` (editions = amounts) is digital, never discounted or taxed and
  can't be paid with another gift card. Paid lines issue one card per copy in `onOrderUpdated`
  (`issueGiftCardsForOrder`, once via `giftCardsIssuedAt`) and email it (template `gift_card`). Cards live in
  admin-read/server-write `giftCards/{sha256(code)}` with `balanceMinor` (CAD cents) and 30-minute `holds`.
  Checkout's code list goes on the order as `giftCards` (rules allow ≤5); `priceOrder` writes `giftCardAmount` +
  `giftCardRedemptions`, and **`total` is what the card/PayPal pays after gift cards**. Holds are taken with stock
  (`reserveCheckout`); the balance is debited only inside the paid transaction (`settleGiftCards`: Stripe webhook,
  verified PayPal capture, `completeOrderWithoutCard`), once (`giftCardsDebitedAt`); a short balance records
  `giftCardConflict` and leaves the order unpaid (Needs attention). A full refund credits it back once
  (`giftCardsRestoredAt`) and disables cards the order bought (`giftCardsVoidedAt`). Orders a gift card fully covers
  use the free path (`completeFreeOrder`); manual payments refuse gift cards; hosted Stripe sessions refuse them.
  Shopper balance check: `validateDiscountCode` `{ action: "giftCardBalance" }` (rate limited). Admin actions:
  `createStripeCheckoutSession` `{ action: "giftCardAdmin", op: issue|setEnabled|adjust|resend }` (`requireAdmin`).
  Deploy `firestore.rules` and Functions with the frontend.
