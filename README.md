# Artsy Website for Publisher

This is a code bundle for Artsy Website for Publisher.
The original project is available at https://www.figma.com/design/NzVBBNBNBtFNCYIT9PgF6l/Artsy-Website-for-Publisher.

## Local development

1. Install dependencies (pnpm pins the React versions; see `CLAUDE.md` › Verification):
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```
2. Start the storefront + admin (one Vite single-page app):
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Backend + Admin (publisher)

There is no separate Node/Express server any more (the old `backend/server.js` and its
`ADMIN_PASSWORD` login were removed). The site talks directly to **Firebase**:

- **Data & files:** Firestore (catalog, orders, settings, pages…) and Firebase Storage, guarded
  by `firestore.rules` / `storage.rules`.
- **Server work:** Firebase Cloud Functions in `functions/` (Stripe checkout and webhook, emails,
  shipping/Shippo, downloads, scheduled sweeps). Run them locally with
  `cd functions && npm install && npm run serve` (emulator); deploy with `npm run deploy` there or
  the `Deploy Firebase` workflow.
- **Admin:** open `/admin` on the site and sign in with **Google**. Access is restricted to the
  shop's allow-listed account (checked in the app and again by `requireAdmin` in the Functions).

See `CLAUDE.md` for the full architecture, commands and deployment notes.

## Production build

Create an optimized build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This repo now includes a GitHub Actions workflow at `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

### One-time repository setup

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. In GitHub, open **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

### How deployment works

- Every push to `main` triggers the workflow.
- The workflow installs dependencies, builds with Vite, uploads `dist/`, and deploys to GitHub Pages.
- You can also run it manually from **Actions → Deploy to GitHub Pages → Run workflow**.

> Note: GitHub Pages only hosts the frontend static site. Firestore rules/indexes, Storage rules and
> Cloud Functions are deployed to Firebase separately (`.github/workflows/deploy-firebase.yml`).

## Going live checklist (e-commerce)

The payment/fulfillment backend runs on Firebase. Before taking real orders:

1. **Secrets (Firebase → Functions → Secrets)** — set real values for:
   - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (live key, `sk_live_...`)
   - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (from the Stripe webhook endpoint pointing at `stripeWebhook`)
   - `RESEND_API_KEY` (transactional email)
   - `SHIPPO_API_TOKEN` (address verification + labels; without it addresses are flagged unverified and label generation refuses to run)
2. **GitHub secret `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`** — JSON service-account key so the
   `Deploy Firebase` workflow can ship Firestore rules, indexes, Storage rules
   and Cloud Functions automatically. Until it is set, deploy manually with
   `npx firebase-tools deploy --only firestore:rules,firestore:indexes,storage,functions`.
3. **Stripe webhook** — in the Stripe dashboard add an endpoint for
   these events: `checkout.session.completed`,
   `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`,
   `checkout.session.async_payment_failed`, `checkout.session.expired`,
   `charge.refunded` (syncs Dashboard refunds) and `charge.dispute.created`,
   pointing to
   `https://us-central1-lyricalmyrical-web-v2.cloudfunctions.net/stripeWebhook`.
   Orders are created `unpaid` and only this webhook marks them paid,
   decrements stock, counts discount redemptions and records revenue.
4. **Policies** — fill in shipping / returns / privacy / terms in Admin →
   Settings before launch (required by Stripe and card networks).
5. **Tax rates** — Admin → Taxes now supports an optional state/province per
   rate (e.g. Canada + Ontario = 13). Add one row per region you must collect
   in; a row with an empty region is the country-wide fallback.
6. **Allowed origins** — if the site moves to a custom domain, add it to
   `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` in `functions/index.js` and to the OAuth redirect URIs in
   `firebase.json`, and set `SITE_BASE=/` when building.
